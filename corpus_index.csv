Wistar rats (15 0– 200 g) were divided into six groups and received orally saline (sham, control group), Ws-50/kg (Ws control and treated group) and Vit E-100 mg/kg (Vit E control and treated group) respectively for 1 month. On the 31st day, rats of the control, Vit E and Ws treated groups were anesthetized and subjected to 45 min occlusion of the LAD coronary artery followed by 60 min reperfusion. Hemodynamic parameters: systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure (SAP, DAP, MAP), heart rate (HR), left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP), left ventricular peak (+)LVdP/dt and (–)LVdP/dt were monitored. Hearts were removed and processed for histopathological and biochemical studies: Myocardial enzyme viz, creatin phosphokinase (CPK), and antioxidant parameters: malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glu- tathione peroxidase (GSHPx) were estimated. Postischemic reperfusion produced significant cardiac necrosis, depression of left ventricular functions (MAP, LVEDP, (+) and (–)LVdP/dt) and a significant fall in GSH (p < 0.01), SOD, CAT (p < 0.05), LDH and CPK (p < 0.01) as well as an increase in MDA level (p < 0.05) in the control group rats as compared to sham group. The changes in levels of protein and GPx was however, not significant. Ws and Vit E favorably modulated most of the hemo- dynamic, biochemical and histopathological parameters though no significant restoration in GSH, MAP (with Vit E) were ob- served. Ws on chronic administration markedly augmented antioxidants (GSH, GSHPx, SOD, CAT) while Vit E did not stimulate the synthesis of endogenous antioxidants compared to sham. Results indicate that Ws significantly reduced myocardial injury and emphasize the beneficial action of Ws as a cardioprotective agent.

Ragauskas1,* The goal of this work is to produce nanocomposite film with low oxygen permeability by casting an aqueous solution containing xylan, sorbitol and na nocrystalline cellulose. The morphology of the resulting nanocomposite films was examined by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy which showed that control films containing xylan and sorbitol had a more open structure as compared to xylan-sorbitol films containing su lfonated nanocrystalline cellulose. The average pore diameter, bulk density, porosity and tortuosity fa ctor measurements of control xylan films and nanocomposite xylan films were examined by me rcury intrusion porosimetry techniques. Xylan films reinforced with nanocrystalline cellulose were denser and exhibited higher tortuosity factor than the control xylan films. Control xylan films had average pore diameter, bulk density, porosity and tortuosity factor of 0.1730 μm, 0.6165 g/ml , 53.0161% and 1.258, respectively as compared to xylan films reinforced with 50% nanocrystalline cel lulose with average pore diameter of 0.0581 μm, bulk density of 1.1513 g/ml, porosity of 22.8906% and tortuosity factor of 2.005. Oxygen transmission rate tests demonstrated that fi lms prepared with xylan, sorbitol and 5%, 10%, 25% and 50% sulfonated nanocrystalline cellulose ex hibited a significantly reduced oxygen permeability of 1.1387, 1.0933, 0.8986 and 0.1799 cm3/g152μm/m2/g152d/g152kPa respectively with respect to films prepared solely from xylan and sorbitol with a oxygen permeability of 189.1665 cm3/g152μm/m2/g152d/g152kPa. These properties suggested these nanocomposite fi lms have promising barrier properties. Keywords: Nanocomposites; Xylan; Nanocrysta lline cellulose; Oxygen barrier Citation: Amit Saxena, Thomas J.

High barrier packaging materials require low oxygen permeability with good mechanical strength. Replacing existing oxygen barriers such as aluminum and synthetic polymers with biopolym ers is a research topic of increased interest. Early studies examined the use of chitosan, starch and cellulose derivatives to address these challenges and were shown to have good film forming properties [5]. Acetylated galactoglucomannan (AcGGM) hemicellulose was found to be an excellent candidate for making new renewable barrier materials [6]. The oxygen barrier permeability of the AcGGM films were found to be similar to, or lower than, the values reported on oxygen barrier films made from glucuronoxylan [7] and other polysaccharides, such as starch [8], chitosan [9] and mixtures of various polysaccharides [10]. Hartman reported oxyge n permeability of 2.0 cm 3/g152μm/m2/g152d/g152kPa for GGM-sorbitol film [6]. The oxygen barrier properties of films obtained from a mixture of O-acetyl-galactoglucomannan and either alginate or carboxymeth ylcellulose were also studied.

Tissue engineering studies rely on such nondestructive measurements to monitor bone graft regeneration area. In this study, we measured bone yield, fractal dimension and trabecular thickness through micro-CT slices for different grafts and controls. Eight canines underwent surgery to remove a bone volume (defect) in the canine’s jaw at a total of 44 different locations. We kept 11 defects empty for control and filled the remaining ones with three regenerative materials; NanoGen (NG), a FDA-approved material (n=11), a novel NanoCalcium Sulfate (NCS) material (n=11) and NCS alginate (NCS+alg) material (n=11). After a minimum of four and eight weeks, the canines were sacrificed and the jaw samples were extracted. We used a custom-built micro-CT system to acquire the data volume and developed software to measure the bone yield, fractal dimension and trabecular thickness. The software used a segmentation algorithm based on histograms derived from volumes of interest indicated by the operator. Using bone yield and fractal dimension as indices we are able to differentiate between the control and regenerative material (p<0.005). Regenerative material NCS showed an average 63.15% bone yield improvement over the control sample, NCS+alg showed 55.55% and NanoGen showed 37.5%. The bone regeneration process and quality of bone were dependent upon the position of defect and time period of healing. This study presents one of the first quantitative comparisons using non-destructive Micro-CT analysis for bone regenerative material in a large animal with a critical defect model. Our results indicate that Micro-CT measurement could be used to monitor in-vivo bone regeneration studies for greater regenerative process understanding. 2. Introduction The work presented here is an analysis to correlate the imaging based quantitative analysis with the pathology of dental regenerative material in a canine mandible using Micro-CT. Nearly one million individuals suffer from fracture due to bone disease in the United States alone. Regenerative material based healing therapies with added nanotechnology based material are among the current trends in healing bone injuries [ 1, 2].

One of the inherent limitations of these systems is limited resolution (<3 lp/mm). There are systems available with higher resolution but their small FOV limits them to small animal imaging only. In this work, we report on region-of-interest (ROI) CBCT with a high resolution CMOS detector (75 μm pixels, 600 μm HR-CsI) mounted with motorized detector changer on a commercial FPD- based C-arm angiography gantry (194 μm pixels, 600 μm HL-CsI). A cylindrical CT phantom and neuro stents were imaged with both detectors. For each detector a total of 209 images were acquired in a rotational protocol. The technique parameters chosen for the FPD by the imaging system were used for the CMOS detector. The anti-scatter grid was removed and the incident scatter was kept the same for both detectors with identical collimator settings. The FPD images were reconstructed for the 10 cm x10 cm FOV and the CMOS images were reconstructed for a 3.84 cm × 3.84 cm FOV. Although the reconstructed images from the CMOS detector demonstrated comparable contrast to the FPD images, the reconstructed 3D images of the neuro stent clearly showed that the CMOS detector improved delineation of smaller objects such as the stent struts (~70 μm) compared to the FPD. Further development and the potential for substantial clinical impact are suggested. Purpose Rotational angiography has been a very effective tool for 3D reconstruction on clinical C- arm gantry systems for years [ 1-3]. These systems have the capability to provide both fluoroscopy and 3D volume reconstruction [ 4-5]. They use either x-ray image intensifiers (XII) or flat panel detectors (FPD), which have inherent limitations that put restrictions on the imaging capabilities. Depending on the detector being used, nominal resolution of these systems is less than 3 lp/mm; however, high resolution imaging capabilities are essential to visualize small vasculature structures. Due to their inherent limitations, present state-of-the- art detectors do not fulfill the criteria for optimum imaging detectors.

Mostly the source code of web services is unavailable to other developers who use these services. The manual effort spent by them in testing these web services is very large in order to increase the interoperability. Thus , automated testing needs to be developed for testing these We b services. This paper reviews test cases for Web Services using reduction techniques Pair -Wise Testing (PWT ) and Orthogonal Array Testing (OAT) and compares the two techniques with general method . The structure of Web Services is specified using UML diagrams. The pre and post conditions for the service rule are specified using Object Constraint Lan guage (OCL). The framework transforms into WSDL - S specifications. These specifications are parsed and transformed into structured DOM tree. Test data set generated by this framework would satisfy the constraints of the WSDL . The test cases are then develop ed based on the data generated, documented in XML based test files. The number of test cases required by general testing, PWT, OAT are compared and the better testing technique for testing Web Services is determined . Keywords : Test case, web service, Reduction, Semantics, Pair wise, Orthogonal Array 1. Introduction The concept of the Semantic Network Model was introduced by the cognitive scientist Allan M. Collins , linguist M. Ross Quillian and psychologist Elizabeth F. Loftus in different journals in the early 1960s [13,14,15,16,17] as a form to indicate semantically structured knowledge. It expands the network of hyperlinked human -readable web pages by inserting machine -readable metadata about pages and how they are connected to each other, enabling automated agents to use the Web more intelligently and do tasks instead users. The term ""Semantic Web"" was first used by Tim Berners -Lee, [12] the inventor of the World Wide Web and director of the World Wide Web Consortium (""W3C ""), which administers the development of suggested Semantic Web standards. He explains the Semantic Web as ""a web of data that can be processed directly and indirectly by machines"". Many of the technologies suggested by the W3C existed before they were located unde r the W3C control . These are utilized in different settings , especially those dealing with information that holds a small and defined domain, and where sharing data is a common need , such as scientific study or data exchange among trades . Moreover , other t echnologies with the same aims have come up , such as micro formats . The Semantic Web works more on the solution . It has publishing in languages particularly intended for data: Resource Description Framework (RDF), Web Ontology L anguage (OWL), and Extensible Markup Language ( XML ). HTML explains documents and the links between them. RDF, OWL, and XML, by contrast, are able to describe conventional things such as people, meet ings, or airplane parts. In order to explain that supplement or replace the content of Web documents, these technologies are joined . Accordingly , content may be shown as descriptive data stored in Web - accessible databases , [18] or as markup within documents (specially , in Extensible HTML ( XHTML ) combined with XML, or, more often, merely in XML, with layout or rendering cues stored separately). The machine -readable descriptions allow content managers to gives meaning to the content, i.e., to explain the structure of the knowledge we have about that content . In this way, a machine is able to process knowledge, instead of text, utilizing similar processes of that of human deductive reasoning and inference , thereby gaining more meaningful outcomes and aiding computers to do automated information collection and research . Like other scient ific fields, specifically computer science, any evaluation needs test data. Test data are data that have been overtly produced or gathered to be utilized in evaluation practices . This is normal for any computer program. Web services as distance uses in a service oriented architecture (SOA) are not exempt from this notion [11] The quality of services is an important issue for making service -based software systems, and testing is needed for assessing the functional correctness, [6,9] performance and reliabilit y of individual also composite services. Nonetheless , the dynamic properties of WS have lot of new problems to old testing methods . First, services are available , bound, raised and integrated at runtime. To integrate into the framework, testing has to be automated consisting automatic test case generation, test performance , test results collection and analysis. Second, WS suggests a fully specification -based process utilizing collections of XMLbased standards, for instance SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), WSDL (Web Services Description Language ), UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery and Integration) and WSFL (Web Services Flow Language). Instead of graphical user interfaces, services are The 3rd International Conference on Computer Engineering and Mathematical Sciences (ICCEMS 2014 ) 468",1department of computer kerman islamic azad university kerman iran,1department of computer kerman islamic azad university kerman iran

AWSCM visualize and capture changes in the form of intermediate artifacts during impact analysis. This paper presents AWSCM modules, intermediate artifacts, components, and its applications. The paper gives insight on computa tion of change impact as well as mapping them to their test cases. Discussion on details of algorithm for the construction of reduce regression test suite. AWSCM can also be useful for top down development of web services using the subset operations in WSDL. Keywords- Web service, WSDL, regression testing, top down development, change impact analysis, SOAP and tool support. I. INTRODUCTION Web service (WS) is an ess ential part of many domains like cloud and grid computing. Changes in the requirement are an inevitable process. Change impa ct analysis on WS is used to automatically map indentified changes to the test cases as discussed in [8][9]. Evolution of WS is an important task that needs some automation. AWSCM does automated WS impact analysis for regression testing an d top down development. We have proposed two WS regression testing approaches, namely, Operationized Regression Testing of Web Service (ORTWS) and Parameterized Regression Testing of Web Service (PRTWS) and prototyped them using AWSCM. The tool helps in selecting the relevant test cases along with test sequences/steps from the old test suite. It saves manual efforts, by automatically detecting changes in a WS and selecting the relevant test cases to construct Reduce Regression Test suite (RRTS). RRTS is used to perform efficient regression testing. Motivation of AWSCM is requirement for the improvement of automated change analysis on Services and mapping those changes to the test cases. AWSCM bridges the gap between changes on Services to its test case. II. RELATED WORKS & TOOLS Tool-based on WSMO (WS modeling ontology) [1] and WSDLDiff [2] are used to extract ﬁne-grained changes from subsequent versions of WSDL. The tools like JRipple [12] and InARTS [11] provide the program organizations, impact analysis and change propag ation for incremental software development. Similarly, AWSCM also comprehends the change impact analysis of WSs. Xiang Fu et al. presented a WSAT tool [14] for the formal analysis of WS, the tool works for intermediate representation, synchronizability with reliability analysis and handling of XML data manipulation. ReSOS group [2][10] is working on the problems of re- engineering in the design and implementation of SOA based systems. Lui, Bouguettaya and Wu in [7] proposed a methodology for WS changes in replacement or addition to using top down changes in long-term composed services. Regression testing of WS is conducted for code based changes in [4][5] and model b ased changes in [6]. III. AWSCM TOOL AWSCM contains two modules for regression testing, namely, ORTWS and PRTWS. ORTWS helps to find the changed operations that can be used in regression testing. PRTWS helps in finding the combinations of inputs to be exercised for regression testing. Normally, automated analysis, accessing and manipulation of WS code are performed using WSDL as interface. AWSCM contains intermediate artifacts, packages, and components shown in fig 1. AWSCM contains five components shown in fig 1 (b). ‘Code Analyzer’ is used for separating method and operation, thereafter performs change impact analysis on them. ‘WSDL Analyzer’ is use for change impact analysis and operation al analysis on WSDL. ‘Diff Analyzer’ uses both ‘Code Analyzer’ and ‘WSDL Analyzer’. ‘WSDL Constructor’ uses the info of ‘Diff Analyzer’ and input WSDL to construct various Subset WSDLs. ‘RRTS Constructor’ is used for construction of various RRTS according to the information of change impact analysis from ‘Diff Analyzer’ and the old test suite. ORTWS module has three intermediate artifacts. Changes at WSDL are captured in Difference WSDL (DWSDL) and changes at code are captured in Unit WSDL (UWSDL). Additionally, we can also capture the need of selective re- testing using another WSDL, known as Reduced WSDL (RWSDL). These intermediate forms of WSDLs combined to form Combined WSDL (CWSDL), which is used for the construction of Combined RRTS (CRRTS) as shown in figure 2. For details refer to [9] as prev ious version of this paper. PRTWS module has the Parameter WSDL (PWSDL) as an intermediate artifact. Parameter WSDL is an extension of Unit WSDL for WS compositions and internal call interaction. Parameter WSDL is created with the operation whose inter- procedural flow is affected i.e. if a called method is undergone changes. PRTWS is also useful to reduce test sequences/steps in the test suite according to the code flow or user selection for the combination of a parameter scenario. PRTWS captures the flow within the operational code as shown in figure 3. 2014 IEEE 6th International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science 978-1-4799-4093-6/14 $31.00 © 2014 IEEE DOI 10.1109/CloudCom.2014.144715 2014 IEEE 6th International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science 978-1-4799-4093-6/14 $31.00 © 2014 IEEE DOI 10.1109/CloudCom.2014.144715",automated web service change management,automated web service change management

Emphasis of analyzer is to access and handle subset of code. This paper proposed a conceptual model that access Subset Service in two steps. First, slicing the Web service based on Subset WSDL (SWSDL) to access Subset Service. Second, the Subset Service is categorized into five layers. This improves and optimizes cost of Web service analysis by slicing and layering the Service. We conducted case studies for few Service projects. SWSDLs are used for Operationalized and Parameterized Web service analysis. Keywords— Web Service, WSDL, regression testing, top down development, change impact analysis, slicing and SOAP. I. INTRODUCTION A Web Service (WS) is a composable unit of web application, which can interact with other applications using operations specified in an XM L based interface called Web Service Description Language (WSDL). Operation of WS is similar to a method signature of functional programming. WS can also be independently de veloped and deployed as a standalone web application. Normally, functional and non-functional testing of WS is performed by testing the operations of WSDL. In general, communication with SOAP message via WSDL is used to perform automated WS analysis . Analysis techniques can be used in change impact analys is, top down dev elopment, and legacy/contract monitoring. WS analysis can be performed to identifying traceability of the affected portions of WS code and WSDL. Analysis cost can be optimized by properly identifying all the affected por tions of the WS. Thereafter these identified portions are us ed to select old test case. Web Service Analysis (WSA) technique is required for WS legacy contracts validation, cost optimization and QoS. WSA techniques are required for regression testing and top down development. Regression testing requires change impact analysis for selective verifying the requirement changes. Top down development requires analysis of functionality or operations. Generally, WSA can be done by using information of WSDL, XSD, code and its composition. State of art is add-on by categorizing various types of necessary WSA. This paper described WSA by accessing subset service using subset WSDL generated by a proposed prototype tool. Selective code portions are used to slice the WS in subset to reduce analysis e fforts. Early paper by the author are [7] on change impact analysis based regression testing of WS. The papers had given mapping of changes in the WSDLs and WS code to the test suite will be helpful in regression testing efficiently. This paper proposed an approach to construct Subset WSDL (SWSDL) to access Subset Service for categorized analysis. II. RELATED WORK Bai et al. in [1] proposed WSDL based automatic test case generation for WS testing. Similarly, we can do WSDL based WSA. M Ruth in [2] described a safe regression test selection technique for WS with control flow and call graph. Romano & Pinzger proposed a tool called WSDLDiff [4] to extract ﬁne- grained changes from subsequent versions of WSDL. El Bouhissi and Malki in [3] proposed a tool based on WS Modeling Ontology (WSMO). WSMO and WSDLDiff gather the selection & change in WSDL. We can further use WSDLDiff and WSMO information to construct Subset WSDLs. Lui, Bouguettaya and others in [6] proposed methodology for handling top down changes in Long-term Composed Services (LCS), by focusing on WS changes in replacement or addition. III. SUBSET WSDL (SWSDL) TO ACCESS SUBSET SERVICE Generally, WS operations are loosely coupled so each operation can be separately analyz ed for their business logic, call request and response. A WS operation is similar to a method or function in a traditional programming language. Client and WS code communication is done with SOAP message between, WSDL as interface defines operation. We can use WS communication flow to identify all affected portions. We can slice the WS code vertically for WSA to execute the WS operation wise as shown in figure 1 (a). Normally, WSDL is used for automated accessing, manipulation and analysis of WS code. This automation can be used for change imapact an alysis based regression testing, analysis based top down dev elopment, and legacy/contract based WS monitoring. Normally, change imapact analysis is required for regression testing. We will construct SWSDLs using info of change imapact analysis on WSDL and WS code. As we know, analysis of operations is required for top down development. We will construct SWSDL using info of automatic operational analysis from the input WSDL and WS code. Using SWSDL, we can pe rform efficient regression testing and top down development of WS. Automatically gathered operations are used to semantically construct SWSDL. SWSDL will help in many domains/fields of WSA. SWSDL constructed with ‘requiredOperations’ such that these operations are required to be analyzed for given input WSDL. Extract all required data and part (message, XSD schema, port, binding, service etc) semantically from the input WSDL. Arrange all the parts semantically according to the WSDL standards and input WSDL, such that a client can 2014 IEEE 6th International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science 978-1-4799-4093-6/14 $31.00 © 2014 IEEE DOI 10.1109/CloudCom.2014.149688 2014 IEEE 6th International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science 978-1-4799-4093-6/14 $31.00 © 2014 IEEE DOI 10.1109/CloudCom.2014.149688",indian institute of information technology design and manufacturing - jabalpur,indian institute of information technology design and manufacturing - jabalpur

Introduction The identification of the human face in 2D has been studied by many researchers, but comparatively few studies have been carried out in the field of 3D face recognition [1]. The challenge with 2D representation techniques is that every 3D object is mapped into a 2D plane because of which it loses its depth information thereby making it more inaccurate . 3D features provide the information which does not affected by change in translation, illumination and posture . Here, we are proposing a simple method to identify an individual's face from a database comprising of different faces.

These systems have applications in various domains like home or bank security, traffic monitoring, defense; and i n public places like railway stations, malls, airports, etc. Our goal is to develop an intelligent real-time surveillance system that can help in increasing the efficiency of the system. In order to cover a large area, we need to install more number of cameras that leads to more number of videos that are to be monitored simultaneously. This in turn increases human intervention and makes it error prone. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to automate the complete system. In the proposed system, cameras are placed in such a way that there is a significant overlap between the field of view of the cameras. This helps in establishing an association between the cameras. The proposed real time surveillance system detects and tracks the objects in motion and provides automatic warning in case of suspicious activities such as unidentified object and restricted zone monitoring. The system provides different views in different cameras, thereby helping in resolving the occlusion in a simple and novel way. The algorithm has been tested o n a CPU platform (Intel dual core with 4 GB RAM) with four wireless IP cameras (1.3 MP EDiMAX camera with night vision support) with a processing rate of 10 fps. This system can handle up to eight cameras o n a GPU platform (NVIDIA GeForce GTX 480) with frame rate of 25fps. Keywords- Multi-camera, surveillance, homography, handshaking, occlusion. I. INTRODUCTION Surveillance system helps to monitor a given area of interest. Multiple cameras are used to cover a large area. I n order to track objects successfully in multiple cameras, one needs to handshake among objects captured in multiple cameras. The key elements of our proposed surveillance system include change detection, tracking, camera coordination, occlusion handling and suspicious activity monitoring. Change detection is a basic module of any surveillance system. The detected changes can be considered as foreground objects by modeling the background. Generally, background subtraction and its variants are used to extract the foreground objects from the video stream taken from a stationary camera [1, 2]. However, detecting the foreground objects becomes hard when the background includes variations due to light, shadows and insignificant periodic changes of background objects (e.g. swaying trees). Bayes decision framework is used to extract foreground objects from a real-time complex video [3] . This method consumes more memory owing to the number of parameters used, thereby increasing the processing time as compared to Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). GMM framework [4] can overcome these limitations. The value of each pixel is modeled as a mixture of Gaussians. According to the persistence and variance of each mixture of Gaussians, the pixel is determined whether it belongs to foreground or background. Once an object is detected, tracking is required to estimate its trajectory in the image plane. In other words, a tracker assigns consistent labels to the tracked objects across different frames of a video. Some of the algorithms used for tracking include detection of discontinuities using Laplacian and Gaussian filters; and are often implemented using a simple kernel. These algorithms are simple, but sensitive to noise, and hard to generalize [5]. Fatih Porikli et al. have described tracking using multiple kernels centered at the high motion areas [6]. Other algorithms make use of pattern recognition, such as neural networks, maximum-likelihood and support vector machines. The majority of pattern recognition algorithms require a set of training data to form the decision boundary [7]. Suspicious activity detection is an essential part of effective surveillance system. Real time surveillance system collects large amount of videos and it is important to automate the system to extract useful information about different types of suspicious behavior. Ismail Haritaoglu et al. [1] have described a system that monitors suspicious activities such as depositing an object, exchanging bags, or removing an object etc. Benjamin et al. [8] presented an overview of a multi camera surveillance system that can automatically extract useful information from a given scene. It also alerts the user if any of the tracked objects breaks certain defined rules. Xiaogang Wang [9] gives an overview of the recent advances in the field of multi camera video surveillance. It compares the existing solutions and also describes the prevalent technical challenges. Steve Shafer et al. [ 10] have described prototype architecture and technologies for building intelligent environments that facilitate the unencumbered interaction of people with other people, with computers and with devices. Kiosk [11] is a vision based human sensing application which uses color stereo tracking and graphical output to interact with several users. The system can detect and track the arrival and departure of potential users in the vicinity of the kiosk and can identify individual users during multi- person interaction. Kidrooms [ 12] is an indoor tracking system where multiple isolated objects can be tracked in real-time.",reena kumari behera pallavi kharade suresh yerva pranali dhane ankita jain and krishnan kutty,reena kumari behera pallavi kharade suresh yerva pranali dhane ankita jain and krishnan kutty

This paper aims to classify troll meme captions in Tamil-English code-mixed form. Embeddings are obtained for raw code-mixed text, and the translated and transliterated version of the text and their relative performances are compared. Furthermore, this paper compares the perfor- mances of 11 different classification algorithms using Accuracy and F1- Score. We conclude that we were able to achieve a weighted F1 score of 0.74 through MuRIL pretrained model. 1 Introduction Technology is ingrained in every aspect of our lives. We require it to communicate with others and thrive in the modern world. We increasingly rely on text- based mediums to interact with technology every day. Hence there is a need for machines to un- derstand natural human languages. However, it is challenging for computers to understand natu- ral languages because of the inherent ambiguity in both the syntax and the semantics of natural language (Priyadharshini et al., 2021; Kumaresan et al., 2021). With the ease of accessing the internet and the surge in the number of social media platforms, so- cial media has become an essential and influen- tial aspect of everyone’s life (Chakravarthi, 2020; Chakravarthi and Muralidaran, 2021). It has also brought about a change in the way regional lan- guages are expressed. Native script of the regional language is not used for exchanges on social me- dia platforms (Chakravarthi et al., 2021). Instead, native speakers use Roman script combined with English words or phrases through code-mixing to express their ideas. The text generated by users in social media contains a high amount of spelling mistakes, phonetic typing, wordplay characters, and modern internet slang (Sampath et al., 2022;Ravikiran et al., 2022; Chakravarthi et al., 2022; Bharathi et al., 2022; Priyadharshini et al., 2022). This is mainly due to the limitation of the En- glish keyboard and the speed at which the modern world moves. Thus, the study of text expressed in code-mixed form is essential (Priyadharshini et al., 2020). In this paper, we explain our submission to DravidianLangTech-ACL2022 for the task of Troll- meme classification in Tamil. Tamil is a member of the southern branch of the Dravidian languages, a group of about 26 languages indigenous to the Indian subcontinent (Subalalitha, 2019; Srinivasan and Subalalitha, 2019; Narasimhan et al., 2018). The earliest Old Tamil documents are small inscrip- tions in Adichanallur dating from 905 BC to 696 BC (Anita and Subalalitha, 2019b,a; Subalalitha and Poovammal, 2018). Tamil, one of the 22 sched- uled languages in the Indian Constitution, was the first to be designated as a classical language of In- dia (Sakuntharaj and Mahesan, 2021, 2017, 2016; Thavareesan and Mahesan, 2019, 2020a,b, 2021). We brief on all the embedding techniques like TF- IDF, m-BERT, MuRIL, IndicFT, etc., and various classification algorithms, including Logistic Re- gression, Decision tree, SVM, etc., that were im- plemented in the process. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 details the related works done in the field, and Section 3 describes the dataset used. Section 4 expands on the methodol- ogy and experimental setup, Section 5 discusses the results obtained, and Section 6 elucidates the conclusions. 2 Related work There has been a rapid rise in the number of inter- esting studies performed in the domain of Dravid- ian code-mixed text analysis in the last few years (Chakravarthi et al., 2021, 2020; Ghanghor et al., 2021a,b; Yasaswini et al., 2021).

Term weighting is a popular pre-processing step for text classiﬁcation, especially when the size of the dataset is limited. In this paper, we propose a new term weighting scheme and a modiﬁcation to an existing one and compare them with many state-of-the-art methods using three popular classiﬁers. We create a labelled Twitter dataset of events for exhaustive cross-validation experi- ments and use another Twitter event dataset for cross-corpus tests. The proposed schemes are among the best performers in many experiments, with the proposed modiﬁcation signiﬁcantly improving the perfor- mance of the original scheme. We create two majority voting based classiﬁers that further enhance the F1-scores of the best individual schemes.

In microblogging, there is a limit to the maxi- mum allowed length of a message (e.g. Twitter restricts the length to 280 characters). Since a large number of users access Twitter using mobile devices, real-world news is of- ten shared ﬁrst on Twitter. In this paper, we consider an event as any newsworthy real-world occurrence discussed on Twitter. For this reason, we use the terms event andnews interchangeably. There can be a large number of tweets discussing an event. The set of event-related tweets has very high-dimensional vocabulary (features), is repetitive and noisy. We refer to a collection of related tweets (in En- glish) discussing an event as an event cluster, an event or a document. The number of real-world events that are detected online during a ﬁxed time duration is generally limited. For ex- ample, Kalyanam et al. [7] were able to detect about 5000 real-world events in a year (including duplicates). Since event datasets are not huge, advanced neural network tech- niques are not applicable, and we need to use traditional methods for classiﬁcation. Term-weighting schemes have traditionally been one of the most popular pre-processing methods for text catego- rization. These schemes are applicable even when the dataset is not very big. There are two types of term- 1www.twitter.comweighting: unsupervised term weighting (UTW) and su- pervised term weighting (STW). UTW schemes such as tf*idf do not consider the category of a term’s containing- document, while STW schemes depend on the category in- formation. A classiﬁer is trained on the labelled dataset consisting of documents with weighted words and the corresponding document category labels. Fig. 1 gives an overview of event categorization using term weighting schemes. Note that event category is a conceptual grouping that contains a similar type of events ( e.g.sports category). Human annotators assign a category label to each event (we discuss the process in Section 4). We ask the following research questions in this paper. Can the existing term weighting schemes categorize noisy and repetitive Twitter event clusters effectively? Can we create a new term weighting scheme or improve existing ones? Would the proposed method and modiﬁcation be effective in general text categorization? Can we improve event categorization by creating voting classiﬁers using term weighting schemes? To this end, we make the following contributions: –We propose a new term weighting scheme and a modi- ﬁcation to an existing scheme for event categorization. We perform cross-validation and cross-corpus classi- ﬁcation using two different datasets. We also evaluate the proposed schemes on multiple balanced and im- balanced sub-datasets. –We show that the proposed term weighting schemes",categorization of event clusters from twitter using term weighting schemes,categorization of event clusters from twitter using term weighting schemes

With limited resources being available, NER for South-East Asian languages like Telugu is quite a challenging problem. This paper attempts to improve the NER performance for Telugu using gazetteer-related features, which are automatically generated using Wikipedia pages. We make use of these gazetteer features along with other well-known features like contextual, word-level, and corpus features to build NER models. NER models are developed using three well-known classifiers—conditional random field (CRF), support vector machine (SVM), and margin infused relaxed algorithms (MIRA). The gazetteer features are shown to improve the performance, and theMIRA-basedNERmodelfaredbetterthanitscounterpartsSVMandCRF.

Introduction Named entity recognition (NER) is a sub-task of information extraction (IE) to identify and classify textual elements (words or sequences of words) into a pre-defined set of categories called named entities (NEs) such as the name of a person, organization, or location, expressions of time, quantities,monetaryvalues,percentages,etc. Theterm named entity wasfirstcoinedatthe6thMessage Understanding Conference (MUC-6) [ 1].

Earlier studies have made use of handcrafted features and gazetteers for identifying named entities (NEs). In this paper, we present a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) - Conditional Random Fields (CRF) based approach that does not use any handcrafted features or gazetteers. The results are compared to those of traditional classifiers like support vector machines (SVMs) and CRFs. The LSTM-CRF classifier performs significantly better than both of them, achieving an F-measure of 85.13%. Keywords: Named Entity Recognition, LSTM, CRF, Word Embeddings 1. Introduction NER is an interesting task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that identifies NEs such as the name of a person, lo- cation or organization in a sentence. NER has numerous applications in NLP and is used while performing text min- ing, machine translation, question answering, indexing for information retrieval, automatic summarization, etc. Telugu is one of the most spoken Indian languages and is highly inflectional and agglutinating in nature. It has one of the richest and most complex set of linguistic rules result- ing in complex word forms. The task of building an NER model for Telugu language has some linguistic challenges like the unavailability of annotated corpora, no gazetteer lists, no capitalization, spelling variations, free word order, etc. NEs in Telugu cannot be identified by capitalization as is the case with English and most European languages. In- flectional suffixes can be added either to the root or to the stem of Telugu words and common nouns can also be NEs in certain cases. The words are also more diverse in nature. NER in Telugu is challenging because of these difficulties. In this paper, we develop a classifier which performs NER in Telugu using LSTM and CRFs. We then compare the performance of our approach with those of popular tools like YamCha and CRF++. The annotated data used for our work has been made available for public use. In Section 2.we discuss related work and in Section 3.we discuss our LSTM-CRF classifier. We describe the other classifiers we tested in Section 4.and our experiments, re- sults and their analysis is documented in Section 5.Finally, we conclude in Section 6. 2. Related Work State-of-the-art NER models are based on LSTMs. They overcome the problems associated with approaches that use handcrafted rules or gazetteers. These approaches are labor intensive and inflexible. Lample et al. ( Lample et al., 2016 ) proposed a language independent LSTM-CRF based clas- sifier which used pretrained word embeddings, character- level embeddings and contextual word representations. A CRF is finally used to perform classification. Our archi- tecture is very similar to the one proposed by Lample et al. They also proposed another LSTM-based architecture inspired by shift-reduce parsers in the same paper. Chiuet al.( Chiu and Nichols, 2015 ) proposed a bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) and a Convolution Neural Network hy- brid model that automatically detects word and character- level features. They reported an F-measure of 91.62% on the CoNLL-2003 dataset. Considerable amount of work has been done on NER in other Indian languages such as Bengali and Hindi. Ekbal et al. (Ekbal and Bandyopadhyay, 2008 ) developed an NER model for Bengali and Hindi using SVMs. It uses various features which are computed based on both the word and the context in which it occurs. They reported F-measures of 84.15% and 77.17% for Bengali and Hindi respectively. In another paper( Ekbal and Bandyopadhyay, 2009 ), they pro- posed a CRF-based NER model for Bengali and Hindi and obtained F-measures of 83.89% for Bengali and 80.93% for Hindi. A CRF-based NER model which can handle nested NEs has been developed for Tamil( Vijayakrishna and Devi, 2008 ), another Dravidian language. Athavale et al.( Athavale et al., 2016 ) used a Bi-LSTM which took Word2Vec embeddings and the parts-of-speech (POS) tags of the tokens as input and output the NE tag. They reported an accuracy of 77.48% for NER in Hindi. Srikanth and Murthy( Srikanth and Murthy, 2008 ) were some of the first authors to explore NER in Telugu. They built a two stage classifier which they tested using their own dataset. In the first stage, they used a CRF to identify nouns. Then, they developed a rule-based model to identify the NEs among the nouns. A CRF-based NER model was also built which made use of handcrafted features. Gazetteers were used to enhance the performance of their classifiers. Overall F-measures between 80% and 97% were reported in various experiments. It is interesting to note that the higher scores were obtained only upon using gazetteer lists. Their work also has several limitations. Firstly, they use hand- crafted rules, features and gazetteers to perform NER which is both labor intensive and inflexible. Secondly, their clas- sifier is only capable of identifying NEs which are one word long. Finally, neither their code nor their dataset has been made available publicly. Our work overcomes all of these problems. Shishtla et.al( Shishtla et al., 2008 ) built a CRF based NER model with language independent and depen- dent features and reported an F-measure of 44.89%.",sai kiranmai gorla lalita bhanu murthy neti and aruna malapati,sai kiranmai gorla lalita bhanu murthy neti and aruna malapati

In this paper, we have attempted to clas- sify textual content from on-line T elugu news- papers using well known generative model. W e have used generic features like contex- tual words and their part-of-speech (POS) to build the learning model. By understanding the syntax and grammar of T elugu language, we propose morphological pre-processing of the data and this step yields us better accu- racy . W e propose some interesting language dependent features like post-position feature, clue word feature and gazetteer feature to im- prove the performance of the model. The model achieved an overall average F1-Score of 88.87% for Person, 87.32% for Location and 72.69% for Organization. 1 Introduction News providers and publishing companies generate hu- mongous amount of unstructured textual content on daily basis. This content is not of much use if there are no tools and techniques for searching and indexing the text. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an im- portant task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to ﬁgure out the named entities in text documents. Named Entities (NEs) are usually proper nouns like name of Person, Organization, Location etc in text Copyright © 2018 for the individual papers by the papers’ au- thors.

Named Entity Recognition can naturally be applied to news articles to identify named entities in those articles. Knowing these named entities in each article help in categorizing the news articles in deﬁned position and empower smooth information detection. NER task was ﬁrst presented at MUC-6 in 1995 [GS96] and since then, the task has undergone several transi- tions beginning from the rule based approaches to the currently used Machine learning techniques. The per- formance of NER task for diﬀerent languages depends on the properties of the language. In English, capitalization feature play an important role as NEs are generally capitalized in this language. The capitalization feature is not available for Indian Languages (IL) which makes the task more challeng- ing. In this paper, we attempt to get some insights and results of NER for T elugu language. The challenges in NER speciﬁc to T elugu language are: a) no capital- ization b) two words in English can be mapped to one word in T elugu. Example: in Delhi (English): ¦Ùǝũ Dhil lI lO where ( ũ) lO is an post-position marker c) absence of part-of-speech tagger d) free word ordering. In this paper, a generative model is proposed for NER task using Naïve Bayes classiﬁer. The following features have been considered for training the model - contextual word, part-of-speech tag, gazetteer as a bi- nary feature, post-position feature and clue word fea- ture. W e are mainly interested in classifying a given word to one of the named entities namely Person, Lo- cation and Organization. The results obtained from the proposed approach are comparable to other com- petitive techniques for T elugu langauge. The rest of the article is organized as follows. W e discuss related work in Section 2 and illustrate dataset in Section 3. The methodology and evaluation metrics are presented in Section 4. In Section 5 and Section 6 we propose features to build Naïve Bayes Classiﬁer and discuss the results.

Ap- plication of natural language processing (NLP) tasks like sentiment analysis is a harder prob- lem on code-switched languages due to the irregularities in the sentence structuring and ordering. This paper shows the experiment results of building a Kernel based Extreme Learning Machines(ELM) for sentiment anal- ysis for code-switched Dravidian languages with English. Our results show that ELM per- forms better than traditional machine learning classiﬁers on various metrics as well as trains faster than deep learning models. We also show that Polynomial kernels perform better than others in the ELM architecture. We were able to achieve a median AUC of 0.79 with a polynomial kernel. 1 Introduction Because of the expansion of user-generated ma- terial, it is now possible to automatically detect linked attitudes. A ”sentiment” is a good or neg- ative opinion, emotion, feeling, or thinking con- veyed by a sentiment bearer (user). In general, sentiment analysis attempts to extract certain sen- timents from text automatically (Sakuntharaj and Mahesan, 2021, 2017, 2016; Thavareesan and Ma- hesan, 2019, 2020a,b, 2021). Sentiment analy- sis seeks to analyse textual patterns in order to ﬁnd a sentiment at the word, phrase, or document level. Sentiment analysis is widely used in a variety of sectors today, including public-health monitor- ing, electoral patterns, predicting terrorist actions, and social network analysis (Sampath et al., 2022; Ravikiran et al., 2022). Dravidian languages, Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam are widely spoken by over 250 mil- lion people, but still is a a sparse language for NLP tasks (Chakravarthi et al., 2021, 2022; Bharathiet al., 2022; Priyadharshini et al., 2022). Dravid- ian languages are a spoken mostly in southern In- dia, north-east Sri Lanka, and south-west Pakistan (Anita and Subalalitha, 2019b,a; Subalalitha and Poovammal, 2018). There have been tiny but im- portant immigrant groups in Mauritius, Myanmar, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Canada, Germany, South Africa, and the United States since the colonial era (Subalalitha, 2019; Srinivasan and Subalalitha, 2019; Narasimhan et al., 2018). Tamil is a member of the southern branch of the Dra- vidian languages, a group of about 26 languages indigenous to the Indian subcontinent. It is also classed as a member of the Tamil language family, which contains the languages of around 35 ethno- linguistic groups, including the Irula and Yerukula languages. The inﬂuence of English in the regions where these languages are spoken is higher due to the colo- nial history and the medium of schooling (Priyad- harshini et al., 2021; Kumaresan et al., 2021). However the ease of expression of sentiments switches between the words in the Dravidian lan- guage and English with most of the bilinguists versatile in both, especially on online social plat- forms (Chakravarthi, 2020; Chakravarthi and Mu- ralidaran, 2021). The sentiment analysis of text written in code-switched language between the Dra- vidian languages and English is analysed in this paper through a novel kernel based ELM. , 2 Related work Multi-class classiﬁcation of text sentiment has been approached in both, traditional machine learning models as well as in deep learning models in the past.

Early detection and effective treatment is the only rescue to reduce breast cancer mortality. Accurate classiﬁcation of a breast cancer tumor is an important task in medical diagnosis. Machine learning techniques are gaining importance in medical diagnosis because of their classiﬁcation capability. In this paper, we propose a new, Genetically Optimized Neural Network (GONN) algorithm, for solving classiﬁcation problems. We evolve a neural network genetically to optimize its architecture (structure and weight) for classiﬁcation. We introduce new crossover and mutation operators which differ from standard crossover and mutation operators to reduce the destructive nature of these operators. We use the GONN algorithm to classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant. To demonstrate our results, we had taken the WBCD database from UCI Machine Learning repository and compared the classiﬁcation accuracy, sensitivity, speciﬁcity, confusion matrix, ROC curves and AUC under ROC curves of GONN with classical model and classical back propagation model. Our algorithm gives classiﬁcation accuracy of 98.24%, 99.63% and 100% for 50–50, 60–40, 70–30 training–testing partition respectively and 100% for 10 fold cross validation. The results show that our approach works well with the breast cancer database and can be a good alternative to the well-known machine learning methods. /C2112015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 1.

A normal cell, in its life cycle, grows in size, dur- ing which it collects nutrients, and then divides itself to form two new daughter cells. Cells become cancerous when they lose their ability to stop dividing, to stay where they belong, and to die at the proper time. Such extra cells together form a mass called tumor. The tumor can be identiﬁed either as benign or malignant. Breast cancer is a malignant tumor originating from the breast tis- sue ( Muto, Bussey, & Morson, 1975 ). Every woman is at risk for breast cancer. If she lives to be 85, there is a one in eight chance (12%) that she will develop breast cancer sometime during her life. As a woman ages, her risk of developing breast cancer rises dramatically regardless of her family history. Treatment and causes for breast cancer are still under research and since there is no widely available preventive measure ( Christoyianni, Dermatas, & Kokkinakis, 2000; Rodrigues, Giraldi, Chang, & Suri, 2006 ) yet, early detection andeffective treatment is the only rescue to reduce breast cancer mortality. Fortunately, if breast cancer is detected accurately in an early stage, localized tumors can be treated successfully before the cancer spreads. Thus, accurate diagnosis of breast cancer is an essential and urgent problem in medical science community. One of the major task for accurate diagnosis is the extraction of useful knowledge from past diagnosis data. Machine learning tech- niques enable computers to learn from experience, past patterns and examples ( Carbonell, 1983; Witten & Frank, 2005 ). Thus, use of machine learning tools in medical diagnosis is increasing gradual- ly. Data mining and soft computing techniques have been applied to extract rules and patterns from various datasets ( Maimon & Rokach, 2005;Mitra & Hayashi, 2000;Mitra & Acharya, 2005 ). Some of these techniques ( Bellazzi & Zupan, 2008;Marcano-Cedeño, Quintanilla- Domínguez, & Andina, 2011;Malmir, Farokhi, & Sabbaghi- Nadooshan, 2013 ) have shown very good results in classiﬁcation problems, which can help medical experts in recognizing diseases. In case of breast cancer diagnosis, a tumor needs to be identiﬁed as benign or malignant based on the sample properties. In terms of machine learning, this problem can be approached as a 2-class classiﬁcation problem based on a set of sample attributes. A wide range of methods have been proposed to forecast med- ical diagnosis of breast cancer with WBCD in literature.

In this paper, we proposed a new cluster validity index to determine an optimal number of hyper-ellipsoid or hyper-spherical shape clusters generated by Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm called as V IDSO index. The proposed validity index jointly exploits all the three measures named as intra-cluster compactness, an inter-cluster separation and overlap between the clusters. The proposed intra-cluster compactness is based on relative variability concept which is a statistical measure of relative dispersion or scattering of data in various dimensions within the clusters. The proposed inter- cluster separation measure indicates the isolation or distance between the fuzzy clusters. The proposed inter-cluster overlap measure determines the degree of overlap between the fuzzy clusters. The best fuzzy partition produced by the V IDSO index is expected to have low degree of intra-cluster compactness, higher degree of inter-cluster separation and low degree of inter- cluster overlap. The efﬁcacy of V IDSO index is evaluated on six benchmark data sets and compared with a number of known validity indices. The experimental results and the comparative study demonstrate that, the proposed index is highly effective and reliable in estimating the optimal value of Cand an optimal fuzzy partition for each data set because, it is insensitive with change in values of fuzziﬁcation parameter denoted by m. In contrast, the other indices [2], [3], [6], [7] fails to achieve the optimal value of Cdue to it is susceptibility with change in m. I. I NTRODUCTION In pattern recognition, one of the most widely used tech- nique is Clustering [1]. It is an unsupervised learning approach in which collection of unlabeled samples are grouped into a meaningful clusters so that, the similarity between samples within the cluster is maximized whereas the similarity between the clusters is minimized. The major objective of clustering algorithm is to partition the data set into Chomogeneous clusters [2] and derive insightful information based on the similarity exhibits within each cluster. The partitions generated by the clustering algorithm determines the belongingness of these samples to the clusters. The produced partitions may deﬁne the hard boundary for samples called as hard clustering. In hard clustering, each sample belongs to only one cluster with degree of membership equal to one or zero. In contrast, the clustering algorithm may produce the fuzzy partitions where the data points are given partial degree of membershipsin multiple nearby clusters. The data points belong to multiple clusters with a degree of membership between 0and1. One of the most widely used clustering algorithm based on the fuzzy sets is deﬁned as Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm proposed by Bezdek [4], [11]. The FCM algorithm detects clusters having centroid prototypes of a roughly similar size i.e. distribution of data is in form of hyper- ellipsoid or hyper-spherical shape [14]. It is required to pre- speciﬁed number of clusters denoted by Cfor the computation of fuzzy partitions in FCM algorithm. However, the partitions produced by the clustering algorithm (hard or fuzzy) depend on the choice ofC. The problem of estimating the correct value of Cand ﬁnding the best partition from the partitions produced by the clustering algorithm is done by calculating cluster validity index [1]. In this paper, we propose a modiﬁed cluster validity index designed for validating the fuzzy partitions produced by standard FCM algorithm. However, many clustering algorithms [4], [5] has been proposed by the researchers to produce the fuzzy partitions. These algorithms generates the fuzzy partitions, that are validated by the cluster validity index. As stated above, FCM algorithm works well for the data sets where the distribution of data is of hyper-ellipsoid or hyper- spherical shape. Therefore, many cluster validity indices [1], [2], [3] have been proposed by the researchers for validating the fuzzy partitions produced by FCM algorithm on different value ofCwhere the generated clusters is of hyper-ellipsoid or hyper-spherical shape. All these indices are mainly based on the optimization of measures known as compactness and separation, to determine best fuzzy partition. Compactness measures the scattering or dispersion of samples within each cluster. The small value of compactness measure indicates that, the samples within each cluster are less scattered and tightly bounded with each other. In contrast, separation determines the segregation between the clusters from one another [2]. The ﬁrst validity index proposed by Bezdek known as partition coefﬁcient (VPC)[7] and partition entropy (VPE) [6] based on optimization of compactness measurement. The (VXB)index proposed by Xie and Beni [8] is based on the optimization of both the compactness and separation measure to ﬁnd the optimal fuzzy partitions. Another index proposed by Fukuyama and Sugeno known as VFSindex [9] also determines the best fuzzy partition by optimizing compact- ness and separation measure.

In this paper, we present a multiple kernel learning approach for the One-class Classiﬁcation (OCC) task and employ it for anomaly detection. Recently, the basic multi-kernel approach has been proposed to solve the OCC problem, which is simply a convex combination of di ﬀerent kernels with equal weights. This paper proposes a Localized Multiple Kernel learning approach for Anomaly Detection ( LMKAD ) using OCC, where the weight for each kernel is assigned locally. Proposed LMKAD approach adapts the weight for each kernel using a gating function. The parameters of the gating function and one-class classiﬁer are optimized simultaneously through a two-step optimization process. We present the empirical results of the performance of LMKAD on 25 benchmark datasets from various disciplines. This performance is evaluated against existing MultiKernel Anomaly Detection ( MKAD ) algorithm, and four other existing kernel-based one-class classiﬁers to showcase the credibility of our approach. LMKAD achieves signiﬁcantly better Gmean scores while using a lesser number of support vectors compared to MKAD . Friedman test is also performed to verify the statistical signiﬁcance of the results claimed in this paper.

But, traditional methods based one -class classifier s are very time consuming due to its iterative process and various parameters tuning. In this pa per, we present six OCC methods and their thirteen variants based on extreme learning machine (ELM) and Online Sequential ELM (OSELM). Our proposed classifiers mainly lie in two categories: reconstruction b ased and boundary based, where three proposed clas sifiers belo ng to reconstruction based and three belong to boundary based. We are presenting both type s of learning viz., online and off line learning for OCC. Out of six methods, four are offline and remaining two are online methods . Out of four offline methods, two methods perform rando m feature mapping and two methods perform kernel feature mapping. We present a comprehensive discussion on these methods and their comparison to each other. Kernel feature mapping based approaches have been tested with RBF kernel and online version of one -class classifiers are tested with both type s of nodes viz., additive and RBF. It is well known fact that threshold decision is a cruc ial factor in case of OCC, so, three different threshold deciding criteria have been empl oyed so far and analyses the effectiveness of one threshold deciding criteria over another. Further, these methods are tested on two artificial dataset s to check there boundary construction capability and on eight benchmark datasets from different discipli ne to evaluate the performance of the classifier s. Our proposed classifiers exhibit b etter performance compared to ten traditional one -class classifiers and ELM based two one-class classifier s. Through proposed one -class classifiers, we intend to expand the functionality of the most used toolbox for OCC i.e. DD toolbox. All of our methods are totally compatible with all the present feature s of the too lbox.

Introduction Novelty or outlier detection [1] has been always prime attention of researchers in various discipline s and one-class classifier [2, 3] has been broadly applied for this purpose. One -class classification (OCC) was coined by Moya et al. [4]. It becomes necessity when data of only one class is available or the data belongs to other classes is very rare. For example, if we want to classify between healthy and unhealthy people. In this case, it is possible to define the range of the data for the healthy people but not possible to define such a definite range for unhealthy people. Because it is possible to prepa re the data based on only existing diseases but not possible to prepare based on forthcoming diseases. Thus the data which is available for training can be taken as positive or normal samples and rest of the samples are not possible to define or very rare or unknown, can be taken as negative or abnormal .

Abstract: The temporal extensions of the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model imposes duration constraints on the availability of roles by allowing periodic enabling and disabling of roles. For deploying these models, a set of roles having associated time constraints are required. Such type of roles are termed as temporal roles and the process of creating them is referred to as Temporal Role Mining . In many real-life scenarios, simply imposing time constraints on role availability may not be sufﬁcient. The system administrator may need to ensure different types of constraints reﬂecting speciﬁc organizational policies. In this paper, we propose a cardinality constraint which restricts the maximum number of temporal roles that a user can activate in a particular time interval. We name this constraint as Temporal Role Assignment Constraint (TRAC) . We formally deﬁne the problem of mining a minimal set of temporal roles in presence of TRAC as the TRAC Temporal Role Mining Problem (TRAC-TRMP) and propose an algorithm for solving it. We also present the experimental results reﬂecting the performance of our proposed approach. 1 INTRODUCTION Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model (Sandhu et al., 1996) has been effectively deployed over the years for protecting resources from unauthorized ac- cesses and thus preventing security breaches. For im- plementing RBAC, a set of roles is required which can be created by an approach known as role mining (Ene et al., 2008). RBAC though quite effective, fails to restrict the accessibility of the permissions present in a role to a speciﬁc time duration. To handle such re- quirements, temporally extended RBAC models like theTemporal Role-Based Access Control (TRBAC) (Bertino et al., 2001) and the Generalized Temporal Role-Based Access Control (GTRBAC) (Joshi et al., 2005) models were proposed. These models allow the roles to be enabled for ﬁxed time intervals dur- ing which the permissions associated with the role are available. Moreover, the GTRBAC model introduces the concept of role activation which corresponds to the actual utilization of the permissions by the users. The role activation duration is either equal to or a sub- set of the enabling duration. †This work was carried out by Sohail Rajdev as an under- graduate student of the Dept. of EEE of BITS Pilani, Hy- derabad Campus. ‡Corresponding Author.To deploy TRBAC or GTRBAC, a set of roles having appropriate duration constraints are required. Such roles are named as temporal roles and the pro- cess of generating them is termed as temporal role mining (Mitra et al., 2013). Temporal role min- ing takes a Temporal User-Permission Assignement (TUPA) matrix (Mitra et al., 2013) as input. The problem of mining a minimal set of temporal roles has been named as the Temporal Role Mining Prob- lem (TRMP) (Mitra et al., 2013). TRMP is an NP- complete problem. Heuristic solutions for solving it has been proposed in (Mitra et al., 2013) and (Mitra et al., 2016). TRMP aims to derive an exact solution where the output perfectly matches the input. Instead, an inexact solution can also be computed such that after assigning the temporal roles to the users, one or more of them may not acquire certain permissions that were originally assigned in the input TUPA. The TRMP variant that generates such an inexact solution has been named as the Generalized Temporal Role Mining Problem (GTRMP) (Mitra et al., 2015) and has been shown to be an NP-complete problem. The authors have proposed a greedy algorithm for solving GTRMP in (Mitra et al., 2015). Other than the num- ber of temporal roles, other optimization criteria have also been considered like the Cumulative Overhead of Temporal Roles and Permissions (CO-TRAP) (Mi-Rajdev, S. and Mitra, B.

Implementation of ABAC requires the creation of a set of attribute-based rules which cumulatively form a policy. Designing an ABAC policy ab initio demands a substantial amount of effort from the system administra- tor. Moreover, organizational changes may necessitate the inclusion of new rules in an already deployed policy. In such a case, re-mining the entire ABAC policy will require a considerable amount of time and administrative effort. Instead, it is better to incrementally augment the policy. Keeping these aspects of reducing administrative overhead in mind, in this paper, we propose PAMMELA, a Policy Administration Methodology using Machine Learning to help system administrators in creating new ABAC policies as well as augmenting existing ones. PAMMELA can gener- ate a new policy for an organization by learning the rules of a policy currently enforced in a similar organization. For policy augmentation, PAMMELA can infer new rules based on the knowledge gathered from the existing rules. Experimental results show that our proposed approach provides a reasonably good performance in terms of the various machine learning evaluation metrics as well as execution time. Keywords— ABAC, Policy Administration, Policy Augmen- tation, Policy Adaptation, Supervised Learning I. I NTRODUCTION In any organization, it is of utmost importance to ensure that all accesses to resources take place in an authorized manner. This can be facilitated through an access control model. Over the years, several access control models have been proposed like the Discretionary Access Control (DAC) model [11], the Mandatory Access Control (MAC) model [27] and the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) [26] model. Over the years, RBAC became quite popular as an effective means of access control. The model has been successfully deployed in various organizations and has been incorporated in a number of products and platforms. The pivotal element of RBAC is roles . In spite of its widespread popularity, the RBAC model suffers from a major drawback of being unsuitable for dynamic environments. In such environments, it is not possible to know apriori the set of all users and the different types of access requests that may occur. Moreover, in situations where two or more organizations interact in a collaborative manner, RBAC cannot be implemented to enforce access control among the different organizations. The reason behind this is that the roledeﬁnitions (in terms of the included permissions) of various organizations may not be the same. Such situations may re- quire the creation of temporary roles in order to facilitate the collaborative interaction. The Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) model [13] was proposed for facilitating access control in dynamic and collaborative environments. ABAC encompasses the properties as well as the beneﬁts of DAC, MAC and RBAC. This model allows users to access resources based on the properties of the users, resources and the environment. As per the terminologies of ABAC, the users, the resources and the properties are referred to as subjects, objects and attributes respectively. Each attribute is assigned a value or multiple values from a pre- deﬁned set of values for every subject, object and environmental condition. In order to determine whether to allow or deny an access request, the attributes of the requesting subject, requested object as well as those of the environment in which the access request is made are taken into account. If each attribute has been assigned a speciﬁc value, then the access request is allowed, otherwise, it is denied. In order to deploy ABAC, a set of rules is required. A rule deﬁnes the required attributes and the corresponding permissible values for each attribute for a speciﬁc type of access. The set of all rules collectively comprise a policy . The process of creating a policy for implementing ABAC is known as policy engineering . Policy engineering can be carried out in two ways - top-down [22] and bottom-up [9], [18], [20], [30]. Bottom-up policy engineering is also termed aspolicy mining . In the current literature, the policy mining problem has been formulated as a minimization problem. Combining top-down and bottom-up approaches gives hybrid policy engineering [7]. An organization intending to migrate to ABAC requires designing an ABAC policy. Also, when an organization having an already deployed ABAC model, undergoes some changes (like the opening of a new department or the introduction of a new academic course), additional ABAC rules reﬂecting the changes need to be generated. Creating ABAC rules ab initio or completely re-mining an ABAC policy requires a considerable amount of administrative effort and time. These overheads can be substantially reduced if an existing policy is used as a reference for the creation of a new ABAC policy for migration. Also, instead of re-mining the complete policy in order to account for the organizational changes, it is more prudent to only create the additional rules. In both the scenarios, the existing ABAC policy can aid the process of creation of new ABAC rules, thereby reducing the effort and overhead of policy administration.arXiv:2111.07060v1 [cs.CR] 13 Nov 2021",varun gumma1 barsha mitra2 soumyadeep dey3 pratik shashikantbhai patel2,varun gumma1 barsha mitra2 soumyadeep dey3 pratik shashikantbhai patel2

In this work, we focus on the energy consumption aspects of cache-enabled wireless cellular networks, speciﬁcally in terms of area power consumption (APC) and energy efﬁciency (EE). We assume that both base stations (BSs) and mobile users are distributed according to homogeneous Poisson point processes (PPPs) and we introduce a detailed power model that takes into account caching. We study the conditions under which the area power consumption is minimized with respect to BS transmit power, while ensuring a certain quality of service (QoS) in terms of coverage probability. Furthermore, we provide the optimal BS transmit power that maximizes the area spectral efﬁciency per unit total power spent. The main takeaway of this paper is that caching seems to be an energy efﬁcient solution.

I NTRODUCTION Fueled by the ubiquity of new wireless devices and smart phones, as well as the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive ap- plications, user demand for wireless data trafﬁc has been grow- ing tremendously, increasing the corresponding network load in an exponential manner. This is further exacerbated by rich media applications associated with video streaming and social networking. In parallel, both academia and industry are now in the urge of evolving traditional cellular networks towards the next-generation broadband mobile networks, coined as 5G networks, targeting to satisfy the mobile data tsunami while minimizing expenditures and energy consumption. Among these intensive efforts, caching users’ content locally at the edge of the network is considered as one of the most disruptive paradigms in 5G networks [1]. Interestingly yet not surprising, recent results have shown that distributed content caching can signiﬁcantly ofﬂoad dif- ferent parts of the network, such as in radio access networks (RANs) and core network (CN), by smartly prefetching and storing content closer to the end-users [2]. Indeed, traditional cellular networks, which have been designed for mobile de- vices with limited processing and storage capabilities, have This research has been supported by the ERC Starting Grant 305123 MORE (Advanced Mathematical Tools for Complex Network Engineering), the projects 4GinVitro and BESTCOM.started incorporating context-aware and proactive capabilities, fueled by recent advancements in processing power and stor- age. As a result, caching has recently taken the 5G literature by storm. The idea of caching at the edge of the network, namely at the level of base stations (BSs) and user terminals (UTs), have been highlighted in various works, including edge caching [3], FemtoCaching [4], and proactive caching [5]. Spatially random distributed cache-enabled BSs are modeled in [6], and expressions for the outage probability and average de- livery rate are derived therein. Another stochastic framework but in the context of cache-enabled device-to-device (D2D) communications is presented in [7], studying performance metrics that quantify the local and global fraction of served content requests. Although most prior work (see [8] for a recent survey) deals with different aspects of caching, i.e. performance characterization and approximate algorithms, the energy consumption behavior of cache-enabled BSs in densely deployed scenarios has not been investigated. This is precisely the focus of this paper. Energy consumption aspects of cellular networks are usually investigated by placing BSs on a regular hexagonal or grid topology and conducting intensive system-level simulations [9]. Therein, the aim is to ﬁnd the optimal values of pa- rameters, such as cell range and BS transmit power, while minimizing the total power consumed under certain quality- of-service (QoS) constraints. Despite its attractiveness, it is rather cumbersome or even impossible to analytically evaluate key performance metrics in large-scale networks. A common simpliﬁcation in modeling cellular networks is to place the BSs on a two dimensional plane according to a homogeneous spatial Poisson point process (PPP), enabling to handle the problem analytically [10]. Several works studied the validity of PPP modeling of BSs compared to regular cellular models (e.g. [11]) and additional insights can be obtained by analyt- ically characterizing performance metrics, such as the spatial distribution of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), coverage probability, and average rate [12], [13]. In this work, we analyze energy consumption aspects of cache-enabled wireless network deployments using a spatial model based on stochastic geometry, which to the best of our knowledge has not been addressed in prior works.

INTRODUCTION Optimization is a very important phase of any data processing model. Since its inception in 1995, DE has drawn the attention of many researchers all over the world resulting in a lot of variants of the basic algorithm with improved performance. Differential Evolution is one of the most powerful stochastic real- valued optimization algorithms in current use. Unlike traditional evolutionary algorithms, Differential Evolution variants induce variety by scaling the differences of randomly selected population vectors and do not use any separate probability distribution for generating offspring. [1] Optimization computes error value as True Value – Approximate value In order to obtain the correct measure of accuracy in an approximate solution, bound of either of the following is obtained: | Error |Re lative ErrorTrue Value Absolute Error | Error |  Optimization is the study of problems that use numerical approximation for the problems of mathematical analysis. In many practical applications analytical methods are unable to give desirable results. In such cases, we often ignore the exact solution and uses approximate methods instead. Thus, the aim is to give efficient methods to obtain answers of such problems in numerical form. The optimization problem that is considered here is in the following form, where a local minimum x* is defined as a point for which there exists some δ > 0 so that for all x such that * *|| x x || ; the exp ression f (x ) f (x)   holds on some region around x* all of the function values are greater than or equal to the value at that point. The motivation behind the present work is to study the convergence of Differential Evolution for the optimization of low dimensional numerical data. In the present paper we discuss Differential Evolution as a numerical optimization technique with improved scale factor that helps in inducing variety and selection of pseudo-random population vector that affects the convergence. The paper has been organized as follows: Section II discusses the Differential Evolution as an optimization algorithm. Section III explains the proposed scale factor and working methodologies of differential evolution with the new proposed scale factor. Section IV discusses the experimental results and finally in section V we conclude the results with future work. 2. DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTI ON Differential evolution (DE) is a simple evolutionary algorithm that was first introduced by Storn & Price in [10] and was primarily developed to optimize real parameter, real valued functions. From then on DE has emerged as a strong, robust, simple yet effective optimization technique. It is a population- based stochastic technique that is suitable for problems where objective functions are non-linear, non-differentiable, non- continuous, noisy, flat, multi-dimensional or have many local minima, constraints or stochasticity [2]. Such problems are difficult to solve analytically. In such cases differential evolution can be used to find approximate solutions to problems. DE is a simple real parameter optimization algorithm that works in cycles as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1: Main Stages of Differential Evolution DE is a population based stochastic technique that searches for a point in D-dimensional real parameter space. It begins with randomly initializing the population vectors. Each of the individual vectors is a chromosome. The characteristic of DE is that it constructs, at every generation, for each element of the given population, a mutant vector. The mutant vector is constructed through a mutation operation based on adding differences between randomly selected elements of the same population to another element[2]. For instance, in classical DE, a mutant vector y is constructed from a current population {x1, x2, x3 ….xm) in the following manner:",national conference on communication technologies its impact on next generation computing ctngc 2012,national conference on communication technologies its impact on next generation computing ctngc 2012

Firstly, a Hindi tagger is proposed which provides part- of-speech tags developed using grammar of Hindi language. For this purpose, Hindi Devanagari alphabets are used and their Hindi transliteration is done within the proposed tagger. Thereafter, a Rules’ based TENGRAM method is described with an illustrative example, which guides to disambiguate multi-cate- gory words within sentences of Hindi corpus. The rules generated in TENGRAM are the result of compu- tation of discernibility matrices, discernibility functions and reducts. These computations have been generated from decision tables which are based on theory of Rough sets. Basically, a discernibility matrix helps in cutting down indiscernible condition attributes; a discernibility function has rows corresponding to each column in the discernibility matrix which develops reducts; and the reducts provide a minimal subset of attributes which preserve indiscernibility relation of decision tables and hence they generate the decision rules. /C2112011 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction Part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging or POST) ( Araujo, 2002; Tapanainen & Voutilainen, 1994 ) is the process of marking up the words in a corpus corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on both its deﬁnition as well as its context (relationship with adjacent and related words in a sentence). POS provides signiﬁcant information about a word and its adjacent members, clues on how a word is pronounced, word sense disambiguation, information extraction and question answering system. POS tagging is harder than just having a list of words and their parts-of-speech, because some words can represent more than one part-of-speech at differ- ent times. Such words are called multi-category words (MCW) and are ambiguous in nature. Our aim is to identify such ambiguous MCWs’ occurring in Hindi corpus and to disambiguate them using Rules’ based TENGRAM method which is proposed by us in the present paper. In 2006, statistical algorithms such as Maximum Entropy Mar- kov Model (MEMM) ( Dalal, Nagraj, Sawant, & Shelke, 2006 ) was proposed which tagged previously unseen Hindi text using fea- tures based on the context, word, dictionary and corpus. These fea- tures captured the known information and then MEMM wasapplied to obtain the label sequence. Another, a comparative study of Unigram, Bigram, statistical Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and rule-based Brill’s approaches for POS tagging was done in ( Fahim, Naushad, & Mumit, 2007; Konchady, 2009 ). All these algorithms consider POS taggers for Hindi, but the tags used are conﬁned to NN: noun, PRP: pronoun, VRB: verb, PREP: postposition etc., which are focused on English grammar. In this paper, we propose a Hindi tagger, having Hindi grammar which is based on Devanagari alpha- bets and their transliteration (elaborated in the next section). Devanagari is the script used for writing Hindi and the characters of Devanagari can be transcribed into English by replacing individ- ual Devanagari letters with corresponding letters from the English language alphabets ( Appendix A ). Also, a Hindi professional can read text which is displayed with our fonts without much difﬁ- culty, which in turn helps in revitalization of Hindi, based on com- putational aspects of the language. In the present paper, we use Rough sets ( Pawlak, 1982, 1991; Polkowski, 2002; Polkowski & Skowron, 1998; Polkowski, Tsumot- o, & Lin, 2000 ) to generate decision tables which are used to devel- op rules in the proposed TENGRAM method. The earlier approaches have mainly utilized the decision trees ( Quinlan, 1987; Subramani- an, Nosek, Raghunathan, & Kanitkar, 1992 ) for the same purpose. Decision tree solves simpler problems better but when number of actions is large, many combinations of conditions exist, and there is a risk of ambiguities and omissions. For such complex cases decision tables are preferred over decision trees. Rough sets 0957-4174/$ - see front matter /C2112011 Elsevier Ltd.

In recent years, a variant of it, Type-2 Fuzzy Logic has gained enor - mous popularity for research purposes. In this paper, an analytical insight is provided into the research patterns of Type-2 Fuzzy logic. Web of Science has been used as the data source which consists of Science Citation Index-Expanded (SCI-E), SSCI, A&HCI and ESCI indexed research papers. 600 research papers were extracted from it in the field of Type-2 fuzzy logic from the year 2000 to 2016, which are analyzed both manually and in an automated manner. The performed study is Scientometric in nature and helps in answering research questions like control terms and top authors in this field, the growth pattern in research publications, top funding agencies and coun-tries etc. The major goal of this study is to analyze the research work in type-2 fuzzy logic so as to track the growth of this discipline through the years and envision future trends in this area. Keywords: scientometric analysis, Type 2 fuzzy logic, Type 2 fuzzy systems, Type 2 fuzzy control, Type 2 fuzzy set 1. Introduction Fuzzy logic (Type-1 Fuzzy Logic) caters to the multi-valued logic. It represents a novel concept in the sense that the “truth value” of any variable un-der consideration may lie from 0 to 1 [1]. Type-2 fuzzy logic is the generalization of type-1 fuzzy log-ic which has the capability to handle a higher level of uncertainty. This is established from the fact that since the invention of type-1 fuzzy logic, there was a speculation in researchers that it doesn’t have any uncertainty value associated with the correspond-ing membership function. The father of fuzzy logic, Zadeh, provided a solution to solve this issue by in- troducing the concept of type-2 fuzzy logic. He intro-duced the type-2 fuzzy sets which have a unique con-cept associated with it that is called the “Footprint of Uncertainty” [1]. This means that in order to classify any set as type-2 fuzzy set, an uncertainty value has to be associated with its membership function which would in turn help in dealing with the real world vagueness. Type-2 fuzzy logic can help solving or improving solutions in many fields, as can be seen by the diver - sity of the papers covered in this review paper, and as such in theory it could be considered as a gener-al form of modeling and coping with uncertainty in any area of application. However, there are limita-tions and challenges in this area, for example: how to optimally design the structure of the type-2 fuzzy systems, how to find the optimal parameter values for a particular application, when to apply modular - ity or granularity to improve results, just to men-tion a few. In addition, the particular form of type-2 fuzzy models could be application dependent, and if this is the case, finding these forms for particular classes of problems is a crucial task. In this sense, this paper is the first step in analyzing what has been achieved to the moment by the type-2 fuzzy re-search community, and then what can also be done in the future. This paper presents an in-depth analysis to chart and map the progress of research work in the field of Type-2 fuzzy logic from the year 2000-2016 based on the research papers retrieved from web of science. The major goal of this study is to analyze the research work in type-2 fuzzy logic so as to track the growth of this discipline through the years. The study per-formed in this paper helps in answering the following imperative research questions:1) What has been the growth rate in the field of type-2 fuzzy logic in terms of research publications? 2) Which journals account for the maximum publica - tion in the field of type-2 fuzzy logic? 3) Which countries and institutes offer higher par-ticipation in the field of type-2 fuzzy logic? 4) Which authors have contributed significantly in the research publications pertaining to the field of type-2 fuzzy logic? 5) What has the ratio been of paid vs. open access publications in the field of type-2 fuzzy logic? 6) Which funding agencies have contributed the maximum in providing grants for the concerned research project based papers in the field of type-2 fuzzy logic? 7) What are the various types of research papers available in the field of type-2 fuzzy logic? Whether they are articles or proceeding papers or do they lie in any other category? 8) Which are the most cited research papers in the field of type-2 fuzzy logic and in which research domain do they lie?",journal of automation mobile robotics intelligent systems volume 12 n 2 20183an analytical insight to investigate the research patterns,journal of automation mobile robotics intelligent systems volume 12 n 2 20183an analytical insight to investigate the research patterns

Introduction While dealing with mathematical and computer science application based optimizations, metaheuris - tics are considered to be among the best computing solutions [1]. Evolutionary computing is a subset of metaheuristics that are motivated by the concept of biological evolution. Instances include genetic algo - rithm, differential evolution and genetic program -ming. Swarm intelligence includes methods like, particle swarm optimization, artificial bee colony algorithm etc. Genetic algorithm is one of the most popular metaheuristic algorithms that is based on the notions of “natural selection” [2]. It follows the con - cept of the “survival of the fittest” and utilizes a fit- ness function for optimization. It finds its applications in various domains ranging from control engineering to natural language processing. Another category of metaheuristic algorithms is particle swarm optimization (PSO) which uses an iter - ative method of evaluation for optimization [3]. A par- ticular population of candidate solutions is moved in the search space till an optimum solution is achieved. Various other algorithms also exist that help in opti - mization using nature inspired computing such as the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm which replicates the behavior of the “honey bee swarm” for practical engineering applications [4]. Fuzzy logic has also been closely associated to op - timization, mainly because of its ability to handle un - certainty, vagueness and imprecision. Due to this it is applied in amalgamation with existing metaheuristic algorithms to give better results. This gives rise to the fuzzy genetic algorithm, fuzzy particle swarm optimi - zation and fuzzy artificial bee colony algorithm. These algorithms have been applied on various applications mainly in the field of computer science. Fuzzy evolu - tionary computing also provides a way to implement real life natural language processing applications like text summarization. Hence one can say that fuzzy log - ic and metaheuristics go hand in hand. In this paper, an analytical study has been per - formed to highlight the role of fuzzy logic in meta - heuristics, evolutionary computing and neuro fuzzy logic. The source of research papers is taken to be Web of Science (WoS). 178 research papers are extracted from it from the time span 1989-2016 [5-182]. The top cited research papers, top research areas, top WoS core categories, fuzzy evolutionary based algorithms, topmost organizations, country wise contribution, top source titles and various control terms are analyzed. The control terms help in identifying the most com - monly discussed research concepts in this field.

Tayal Received: 7 June 2013 / Accepted: 14 January 2014 / Published online: 4 February 2014 © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014 Abstract In order to improve the retrieval performance, the query is reformulated by the process of Query expansion(QE). Most of the existing query expansion techniques do not consider the context of the terms present in the user’s query which can result in low precision and recall. Through thispaper, the query consisting of ambiguous terms (polysemy words) is expanded by selecting the terms, which are in close proximity to the query terms while context meaning of theterms is automatically incorporated. The basis of this query expansion method is to investigate the role of graph structure (which is being created for the query) and determining theimportance of each node in the graph using WordNet. Therelevant nodes representing word senses are identiﬁed from the graph and can be chosen as additional terms to be added to the query for improving the retrieval of web pages. The exper-iments, conducted on data sets of ambiguous queries show that proposed approach outperforms other query expansion methodologies by enhancing precision and recall.

The main aim of informationretrieval system is to evaluate the degrees of relevance of the collected documents with respect to a user’s query and retrieve the documents with a high degree of satisfaction tothe user. But sometimes, it results in the retrieval of irrele- vant documents along with relevant documents, as the user is unclear about the information actually needed. The uncer-tainty in the user’s query induces ambiguity due to whichinappropriate documents are retrieved. In addition, heteroge- neous and dynamically changing information are the major challenges of web data [ 2], which results in low precision. In order to improve the retrieval efﬁciency, QE technique is used in which user’s query is modiﬁed by addition of cer- tain terms into the original query The expansion of the initialquery is done by ﬁnding and adding the relevant terms from the retrieved documents to the initial query, and weighing of the terms is done using an appropriate weighing technique[3,4]. Through query expansion, the ambiguity of terms can be dealt and the effects of the word mismatch problem are reduced which is a result of different terms being used in reference to a single concept, both in the documents and inthe user queries. The process of adding terms to the query can either be manual, automatic or user-assisted. In literature there are several techniques for query expan- sion, such as relevance feedback technique [ 5] in which the user is presented with list of answers to the query and the user can then mark as relevant or irrelevant to the informa-tion need. A variation of relevance feedback, namely, pseudorelevance feedback was proposed by Buckley et al. [ 6].

Our approach is divided into six modules, namely—data extraction (DE), data preprocessing (DP), clustering, Google map representation, classiﬁcation andWEKA /C210implementation. First module, DE extracts the unstructured crime dataset from various crime Web sour- ces, during the period of 2000–2012. Second module, DPcleans, integrates and reduces the extracted crime data into structured 5,038 crime instances. We represent these instances using 35 predeﬁned crime attributes. Safeguardmeasures are taken for the crime database accessibility. Rest four modules are useful for crime detection, criminal identiﬁcation and prediction, and crime veriﬁcation,respectively. Crime detection is analyzed using k-means clustering, which iteratively generates two crime clusters that are based on similar crime attributes. Google mapimproves visualization to k-means. Criminal identiﬁcation and prediction is analyzed using KNN classiﬁcation. Crime veriﬁcation of our results is done using WEKA /C210. WEKA/C210 veriﬁes an accuracy of 93.62 and 93.99 % in the formationof two crime clusters using selected crime attributes. Ourapproach contributes in the betterment of the society by helping the investigating agencies in crime detection and criminals’ identiﬁcation, and thus reducing the crime rates.

Abstract: Various classical techniques such as linear regression, nearest neighbor have been used in developing predictive models in the past. But the methodologies developed using fuzzy time series includes a wide array of work that requires special attention. The time series analysis has been of great importance to engineering and economy problems. In this paper, we present a brief summary of the various infamous methodologies available in the literature for forecasting of numerical data using fuzzy time series that includes stock prediction, temperature prediction , foreign exchange daily price estimate, crop production, educational enrollments forecasting , inventory demand and also a brief mention of the limitations of fuzzy time series. Keywords: Fuzzy time series, Forecasting, Fuzzy time series limitations. 1. Introduction The idea of fuzzy was born in 1965 when Lofti A. Zadeh, a well- respected professor in the department of electrical engineering and computer science at University of California, Berkeley, believed that all real world problems could be solved with efficient and analytical methods. In his words, “We need a radically different kind of mathematics, the mathematics of fuzzy or cloudy quantities which are not described in terms of probability distributions ”. Initially, the concept of fuzzy sets encountered sharp criticism from the academic community. Owing to this, fuzzy logic grew in both wide and comprehensive way and established the foundation of fuzzy logic technology and led to the development of application of this technology in the following years [21]. In addition to maintain the usage legacy of fuzzy logic, fuzzy time series was used for forecasting low dimensional numerical data. Till date the research is flourishing in order to achieve a more flexible and more powerful methods and structures to solve real world problems that deal with high amount of uncertainty that grow due to the dynamics of the environment.In this paper, a brief survey of the use of fuzzy time series is highlighted. A concise description of the various methods has been provided. Section 2 provides a quick view of the fuzzy time series principles. Section 3 explains the various infamous methodologies that have been used for forecasting numerical low dimensional data using fuzzy time series. Section 4 outlines the limitations of fuzzy time series and finally in section 5 we conclude the results. 2. Fuzzy Time Series In view of making the exposition self-contained, the various definitions and properties of fuzzy time series forecasting found in [14,15,16] are summarized and reproduced as: Definition 1. A fuzzy set is a class of objects with a continuum of grade of membership. Let U be the Universe of discourse with U = {u1, u2, u3 . . . un},where u i are possible linguistic values of U, then a fuzzy set of linguistic variables A i of U is defined by Ai = μAi (u1)/u1+ μAi (u2)/u2+ μAi (u3)/u3+ . . . + μAi (un)/un (1) here μAi is the membership function of the fuzzy set Ai, such that μAi : U = [0, 1]. If uj is the member of A i, then μAi (uj) is the degree of belonging of u j to Ai. Definition 2. Let Y(t) ( t = . . ., 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .), is a subset of R, be the universe of discourse on which fuzzy sets f i(t) (i=1, 2, 3, . . .) are defined and F(t) is the collection of f i, then F(t) is defined as fuzzy time series on Y(t ). Definition 3. Suppose F(t) is caused only by F(t −1) and is denoted by F(t −1)→F(t); then there is a fuzzy",devendra tayal shilpa sonawani gunjan ansari charu gupta international journal of,devendra tayal shilpa sonawani gunjan ansari charu gupta international journal of

Firstly, comparison of social networks can be done on different parameters at all the three levels – network, group and node level characteristics. Secondly, for getting more accurate results, the paper has incorporated weights to these parameters according to their importance. For addressing these two, the paper has taken an advantage from the Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) operator in the proposed algorithm. This algorithm outputs one quantitative value for each of the social network, on which the comparison has to be made. This paper has also employed the Gephi tool, in order to accomplish the quantitative and graphical comparison between the social networks. The analysis has been done on multiple varied social network data sets. This paper has made an effort to analyze, which among them is better in terms of connectivity and cohere ncy factors. The paper takes into account six vital metrics of the social networks so that there will be low complexity with high accuracy. They are average degree, network diameter, graph density, modu larity, clustering coefficie nt and average path length. The proposed SNA approach is very advantageous for finding the potential group suited for a particular task in different areas like identification of criminal activities, and more fields like economic s, cyber security, medicine etc. Index Terms —Gephi, OWA (Ordered Weighted Averaging), Social Network, Social Network Analysis (SNA) . I. INTRODUCTION A social network [1]-[4] is defined as a set of nodes, where each node depicts a social circle on its own, connected with each other via links The social structure, which defines the network, depicts a relationship among the nodes. This relationship is central to the very existen ce of the mankind. One can identify a social group, nearly anywhere around them, including the social circle in the office and family. The social networks examples are pervasive, and widespread in the areas like representing the friendship linkages in the online social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter), offline social groups that are concerned with business opportunities, groups of people concerned with an activity. Thus, it is crucial to study the parameters affecting the modeling of these social networ ks. This allows analyzing the ties, relationships, and nodes of any network beholding importance in a particular task. The study and analysis of these ties named as social network analysis, helps in identifying the patterns and also to examine network dynamics. The social network analysis [4]-[6] is made up of variety of different small tasks - identification, extraction, visualizations, classification, comparison, modification and molding of the social networks. All of these tasks have varied advantages and importance in the real world. The social network analysis is useful in wide range of disciplines. SNA helps in identifying key nodes in a network, to determine the leader in a network. It is used to predict terrorist attacks by the prominent groups of major associations. The vast span of the applications of social network analysis makes it a crucial domain of study. The scientists and researchers are pouring in the resources to apply concepts of machine learning, and artificial intelligence to make the progress in this field. Thus, it makes sense to develop a quantitative algorithm, which helps in enhancing the quality of results obtained by one such fragment of SNA, namely, the comparison of the social networks. Comparing the social networks is one of the potential challenging tasks in the SNA as discussed in our previous work [5] under communication. It can be used as the vital part of the SNA for its fruitful application in various diverse fields. One might wonder the uses of the comparison operation, and the need for such an important task. There are numerous reason why this is a vital and mandatory operation. The comparison helps in addressing the issue of identifying the criminal group among the innocent groups. It also helps in finding the",published online march 2018 in mecs (http: www mecs -press org ),published online march 2018 in mecs (http: www mecs -press org )

T ayal NAMED-ENTITY RECOGNITION FOR HINDI LANGUAGE USING CONTEXT P A TTERN-BASED MAXIMUM ENTROPY Abstract This paper describes a named-entity-recognition (NER) system for the Hindi language that uses two methodologies: an existing baseline maximum entropy-based named-entity (BL-MENE) model, and the proposed context pattern-based MENE (CP-MENE) framework. BL-MENE utilizes several base- line features for the NER task but suffers from inaccurate named-entity (NE) boundary detection, misclassification errors, and the partial recognition of NEs due to certain missing essentials. However, the CP-MENE-based NER task incorporates extensive features and patterns that are set to overcome these problems. In fact, CP-MENE’s features include right-boundary , left-boundary , part-of-speech, synonym, gazetteer and relative pronoun features. CP-MENE formulates a kind of recursive relationship for extracting highly ranked NE pat- terns that are generated through regular expressions via Python@code. Since the web content of the Hindi language is arising nowadays (especially in health care applications), this work is conducted on the Hindi health data (HHD) corpus (which is readily available from the Kaggle dataset). Our experiments were conducted on four NE categories; namely , Person (PER), Disease (DIS), Consumable (CNS), and Symptom (SMP).

Introduction Largely it is believe that major chunk of web server resources are used to handle human visitor’s generated traffic for any web portal. This belief seems to be a myth if we look at recent reports [1] which states that major portion of web traffic is generated through automatic software agents. Most website owners simple rely on web analytics tools to track who’s visiting their site, but these tools doesn’t show you 51% of your site’s traffic including some seriously shady no n-human visitors like web robots (also known as web crawlers, spiders, wanderers, and harvesters etc) which is used for non - malicious (by search engines) and malicious reasons (by hackers, scrapers, spammers and spies) of all sorts who are easily thwarted, but only if they’re seen and blocked [1]. With the advent of web 2.0 services web robots are the Internet’s silent majority behind the scenes, billions of these software agents are hard at work, shaping our web experience a nd playing a key role in everything we do online. These types of robots include Indexers (or search engine crawlers) seeks to harvest as much web content as possible on a regular basis, in order to build and maintain large search indexes. Analyzers (or sho pping bots) crawl the web to compare prices and products sold by different e-Commerce sites. Experimental (focused crawlers) seek and acquire web -pages belonging to pre -specified thematic areas. Harvesters (email harvesters) collect email addresses on behalf of email marketing companies or spammers. Verifier (site -specific crawlers) performs various website maintenance chores, such as mirroring web sites or discovering their broken links. RSS crawler use to retrieve information from RSS feeds of a web site or a blog. Scrapers used to automatically create copies of web sites for malicious purposes. Since their inception (First web robots were introduced in 1993) they are increasing exponentially. Because they are very simple to create and they offer great job by circumvent collection of information [2,3] . This paper is organized as follows: in section 2 , we discuss the previous works on access behaviour of robots and human visitors. In section 3, we outline the brief description of methodology adopted for this work. In section 4, we present the various comparison metrics and perform the experiments.

The various nodes in MANET move randomly, and this node mobility may pose challenges on the performance of routing protocols. In this paper, an Intra and intergroup performance review of various MANET routing protocols are performed under varying speed of nodes. The routing protocols included in this study are reactive, p roactive, and hybrid protocols. This performance review is done using the NS2 simulator and random waypoint model. The routing protocols performanc e is assessed through standard performance measure metrics including pac ket delivery ratio, throughput, routing overhead and end to end delivery with varying speed of nodes. The simulations result shows that there is no significant impact of varying speed of nodes on standard perfor mance evaluation metrics.

INTRODUCTION With the development of cutting edge technology enabled powerful portable dev ices and availability of cost effective wireless communication, mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) are gaining popularity. MANETs are deploying for different applications ranging from military to n atural disaster management. Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) connects wireless mobile nodes which have an arbitrary motion which makes the topology unpredictable [1],[2] . It is self-organizing and self-configuring and can be deployed without any wired base stations or infrastructure support. The mobile nodes act as hosts and also as routers to send the data across the networks. A MANET is a collection of free mobile nodes such as laptops, smartphones, tablet PC , etc. It has many characteristics. In MANETs, there is no central server and nodes th emselves are responsible for communicating with other nodes to carry out network operations such as on-demand routing[3]. Nodes are free to move anywhere whenever and wherever they want, and they are also free to change their speeds [4] . Therefore, the network topology changes randomly and at uncertain times. Nodes can send messages to other nodes which are not in range or nor directly connected with the help of intermediate nodes [5]. MANET has many advantages. It is scalable as it supports the addition of more mobile nodes in the network. The information can be accessed irrespective of the geographic position of nodes [5]. The use of mobile nodes results in many connection failures. The routing protocols are designed to handle these situations [6]. MANETs are fault tolerant. The main advantage is that the nodes d o not need wireless routers to connect to the internet[7].Therefore, it reduces the cost of deploy ing a router and affordable than a",international journal of electrical and computer engineering (ijece),international journal of electrical and computer engineering (ijece)

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is an eye ailment which influences eighty to eighty-five percent of the patients who have diabetes for more than ten years. The retinal fundus images are commonly used for detection and analysis of diabetic retinopathy disease in clinics. The raw retinal fundus images are very hard to process by machine learning algorithms. In this paper, pre-processing of raw retinal fundus images are performed using extraction of green channel, histogram equalization, image enhancement and resizing techniques. Fourteen features are also extracted from pre-processed images for quantitative analysis. The experiments are performed using Kaggle Diabetic Retinopathy dataset, and the results are evaluated by considering the mean value and standard deviation for extracted features. The result yielded exudate area as the best- ranked feature with a mean difference of 1029.7. The result attributed due to its complete absence in normal diabetic images and its simultaneous presence in the three classes of diabetic retinopathy images namely mild, normal and severe. Keywords : Diabetic retinopathy; Image processing, Retinal fundus images; Feature extraction exudate area. INTRODUCTION In the recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of diabetic patients suffering from diabetic retinopathy (DR). DR is one of the most chronic diseases which make the key cause of vision loss in middle-aged people in the developed world1. DR emerges as small changes in the retinal capillaries. The first differentiable deviations are microaneurysms which are local disruptions of the retinal capillary. The distorted microaneurysms cause the creation of intraregional hemorrhage. This leads to the first stage of DR which is commonly termed as mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy2. Due to the sensitivity of eye fundus to some vascular diseases, fundus imaging technique is more suitable for noninvasive kind of screening. The result of the screening approach is directly related to the quality and accuracy of the fundus image extraction technique coupled with efficient image processing methodologies3 for identifying the abnormalities4,5. Exudates are nothing but oily formations leaking from the poor end blood vessels. Starts emerging, the DR is termed as moderate non- proliferative diabetic retinopathy. If these exudates start developing around the central vision area, it is called as diabetic maculopathy. After a certain time, when the retinopathy increases, the blood vessels get blocked by the microinfarcts in the retina. These small infarcts are known as soft exudates. When the presence of the above three abnormalities are encountered together, this kind of retinopathy is then termed as severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy6”. Several techniques have been used to detect and classify DR, which includes fluorescein angiography, direct and indirect ophthalmoscope, stereoscopic color film fundus photography,",biomedical pharmacology journal vol 10(2) 615-626 (2017),biomedical pharmacology journal vol 10(2) 615-626 (2017)

ENSEMBLE LEARNING APPROACH FOR CLICKBAIT DETECTION USING ARTICLE HEADLINE FEATURES Dilip Singh Sisodia National Institute of Technology Raipur, Raipur, India dssisodia.cs@nitrr.ac.in ABSTRACT Aim/Purpose The aim of this paper is to propose an ensemble learners based classification model for classification clickbaits from genuine article headlines . Background Clickbaits are online articles with deliberately designed misleading titles for luring more and more readers to open the intended web page . Clickbai ts are used to tempted visitors to click on a particular link either to mon etize the landing page or to spread the false news for sensationalization . The presence of clickbaits on any news aggregator portal may lead to an unpleasant experience for readers. Therefore, it is essential to distinguish clickbaits from authentic headlines to mi t- igate their impact on readers’ perception. Methodology A total of one hundred thousand article h eadlines are collected from news a g- gregator sites consists of clickbaits and authentic news headlines. The collected data samples are divided into five training sets of balanced and unbalanced data. The natural language processing techniques are used to extract 19 manually s e- lected features from article headlines. Contribution Three ensemble learning techniques including bagging, boosting , and random forests are used to design a classifier model for classifying a given headline into the clickbait or non -clickbait. The performances of learners are evaluated using accuracy, preci sion, recall, and F-measures . Findings It is observed that the random forest classifier detects clickbaits better than the other classifiers with an accuracy of 91.16 %, a total precision, recall, and f - measure of 91 %.

In this method of pattern recognition the system will be trained with sets of various patterns this set will contain number of same patterns. After training the network for the entire pattern set, it should be able to recognize the input patterns taken through alre ady stored media file of patterns or directly from video capturing de vice like web camera. To show the application of proposed method here we consider the static hand gesture of any sign language as a input pattern and demonstrate the proposed method experimentally. Keywords —Pixel intensity, pattern sets, error back propagation, sigmoidal, continuous and differentiable. I. INTRODUCTION ATTERN recognition has become much important and interesting application to solve various problems from very long time. Pattern recognition is still active area of research. Here we are applying multilayer Back propagation neural network in combination with pixel intensity based skin color detection algorithms to recognize static hand Gestures of any sign languages. Sign language is one form of communication for the hearing and speech impaired. Similar to spoken language, there is no universal sign language. Sign language is itself a separate language with its own grammar and rules. Some signs are expressed as static gestures while others incorporate some dynamic hand movements. For static gestures, the prominent sign is captured within a specific time frame. For dynamic gestures, a sequence of finger and hand positions needs to be identified and analyzed in order to be recognized. The focus of this paper is to demonstrate the application of proposed pattern recognition algorithm on static gestures with a single hand. Here we present the application of neural network for pattern recognition in conjunction with other technique. In this paper we want to demonstrate two things: 1. To apply the concepts of an ANN for pattern recognition. 2. To improve the efficiency of pattern recognition by using ANN. II. RELATED WORK A. Neural Network Neural network possesses the capability of pattern recognition. Researchers have reported various neural network models capable of pattern recognition [2]. Dilip Singh Sisodia is with De partment of Computer Science and Engineering of National Institute of Technology Raipur G.E. Road Raipur(C.G.)-492010,India( Email: Sisodia_dilip@rediffmail.com ) Dr. Shrish Verma is with Departme nt of Electronics and Communication Engineering of National Institute of Technology Raipur G.E. Road Raipur(C.G.)-492010,India. The error back propagation algorithm has been a significant milestone in neural network research back-propagation training algorithm when applied to a feed forward multi-layer neural network is known as Back propagation neural network. Functional signals flows in forward direction and error signals propagate in backward direction. That's why it is Error Back-propagation network. The activation function that can be differentiated (such as sigmoidal activation function) is chosen for hidden and output layer computational neurons. The algorithm is based on error-correction rule [4]. B. Pattern Recognition Pattern recognition is the study of how machines can observe the environment, learn to distinguish patterns of interest from their background, and make sound and reasonable decisions about the categories of the patterns. A pattern can be a image, a handwritten word, a human face, or a speech signal. Given a pattern, its recognition may consist one of the following two tasks: 1) supervised learning in which the input pattern is identified as a member of a predefined class, 2) unsupervised learning in which the pattern is assigned to a hitherto unknown class. The recognition problem here is being posed as a classification or categorization task, where the classes are either defined by the system designer or are learned based on the similarity of patterns The rapidly growing and available computing power, while enabling faster processing of huge data sets, has also facilitated the use of elaborate and diverse methods for data analysis and classification. At the same time, demands on automatic pattern recognition systems are rising enormously due to the availability of large databases and stringent performance requirements. The design of a pattern recognition system essentially involves the following three aspects: 1) data acquisition and preprocessing, 2) data representation, and 3) decision making. The problem domain dictates the choice of sensor(s), preprocessing technique, representation scheme, and the decision making model. It is generally agreed that a well-defined and sufficiently constrained recognition problem will lead to a compact pattern representation and a simple decision making strategy. Learning from a set of examples (training set) is an important and desired attribute of most pattern recognition systems. The four best known approaches for pattern recognition are: 1) template matching, 2) statistical classification, 3) syntactic or structural matching, and 4) neural networks. C. Skin modeling The final goal of skin color detection is to build a decision rule that will discriminate between skin and non-skin pixels. This is usually accomplished by introducing a metric, which measures distance (in general sense) of the pixel color to skin tone. The type of this metric is defined by the skin color modeling method .One method to build a skin classifier is to define explicitly (through a number of rules) the boundaries skin cluster in some color space.

Diabetes is not only aﬀected by various factors like height, weight, hereditary factor and insulin but the major reason considered is sugar concentration among all factors. The early identiﬁcation is the only remedy to stay away from the complications [29]. Many researchers are conducting experiments for diagnosing the diseases using various classiﬁcation algorithms of machine learning approaches like J48, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Decision Table etc. as researches haveproved that machine-learning algorithms [1],[12],[6] works better in diagnosing diﬀerent diseases. Data Mining [15], [2] and Machine learning algorithms gain its strength due to the capability of managing a large amount of data to combine data from several diﬀerent sources and integrating the background information in the study [8]. This research work focuses on pregnant women suﬀering from diabetes. In this work, Naive Bayes, SVM, and Decision Tree machine learning classiﬁcation algorithms are used and evaluated on the PIDD dataset to ﬁnd theprediction of diabetes in a patient. Experimental performance of all the three algorithms are compared on various measures and achieved good accuracy [11]. The remaining of the research discussion is organized as follows: Section-II briefs Related Work of various classi- ﬁcation techniques for prediction of diabetes, Section-III describes the Methodology and brief discussion of Dataset used, Section-IV discusses evaluated Results, and Section-V determines the Conclusion of the research work. 2. Related Work: Sajida et al. in [20] discusses the role of Adaboost and Bagging ensemble machine learning methods [18] using J48 decision tree as the basis for classifying the Diabetes Mellitus and patients as diabetic or non diabetic, based on diabetes risk factors. Results achieved after the experiment proves that, Adaboost machine learning ensemble technique outperforms well comparatively bagging as well as a J48 decision tree. Orabi et al. in [19] designed a system for diabetes prediction, whose main aim is the prediction of diabetes a candidate is suﬀering at a particular age. The proposed system is designed based on the concept of machine learning,by applying decision tree. Obtained results were satisfactory as the designed system works well in predicting the diabetes incidents at a particular age, with higher accuracy using Decision tree[22], [7]. Pradhan et al in [4] used Genetic programming (GP) for the training and testing of the database for prediction of diabetes by employing Diabetes data set which is sourced from UCI repository. Results achieved using Genetic Programming [25], [21] gives optimal accuracy as compared to other implemented techniques. There can be signiﬁcant improve in accuracy by taking less time for classiﬁer generation. It proves to be useful for diabetes prediction at low cost. Rashid et al. in [28] designed a prediction model with two sub-modules to predict diabetes-chronic disease. ANN (Artiﬁcial Neural Network) is used in the ﬁrst module and FBS (Fasting Blood Sugar) is used in the second module.Decision Tree (DT)[10] is used to detect the symptoms of diabetes on patient¢¢s health. Nongyao et al. in [17] applied an algorithm which classiﬁes the risk of diabetes mellitus. To fulﬁll the objective au- thor has employed four following renowned machine learning classiﬁcation methods namely Decision Tree, ArtiﬁcialNeural Networks, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes. For improving the robustness of designed model Bagging and Boosting techniques are used. Experimentation results shows the Random Forest algorithm gives optimum results among all the algorithms employed. 3. Methodology Used: 3.1.

I. INTRODUCTION Web server log repositories are great source of knowledge, which keeps the record of web usage patterns of different web users. The Web usage mining is the process of applying data mining techniques to discover hidden, valuable and interesting usage patterns from web data, in order to understand and better serve the needs of web-based applications. Digging out hidden and fascinating knowledge from web server logs data is going to more and more appealing day by day so web usage mining research engrossed lot of thoughts in present time [1]. A. Background Web mining is an appliance of data mining techniques to large web log data repositories [2].This term was coined by Etzioni in 1996[16]. The whole Web mining process is generally divided in to three different but interdependent categories by researchers on the basis of input data used by them like web structure mining, web content mining and web usage mining. In 1971 R.Cooley introduced specific term web usage mining which is defined as the process of automatic discovery of user access behavior patterns from web servers log data [1]. While the web content and structure mining is mainly dependent on the primary data of the web, while web usage mining uses the secondary data which is derived from the interactions of the users with the web. On the basis of spatial location based collection of user interactions record, this data may be further classified in to three different categories: first the web server data (which is a cumulative representation of the usage of a service by all users), second the client side data (which is the complete depiction of usage of all services by a particular client), and third the proxy server data (which is being somewhere in the middle). Other auxiliary information like user registration data, user sessions, browser cookies, user queries, click streams, and any other data generated during the user interactions with web may be used for web usage mining process. The obtained results can be used in various applications like traffic analysis, efficient website administration, adequate hosting resources, site modifications, system improvement and personalization and business intelligence. Figure 1: Web Mining Categories B. Frequently used terms Following terms are frequently used in web usage mining process: A resource, according to the W3C's Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) specification, can be anything that has identity"" Moreover, an URI is a compact string of characters for identifying an abstract or physical resource”. Examples are HTML file, an image, and a Web service etc. A Web resource is a resource accessible thr ough any version of the HTTP protocol (for example, HTTP 1.1 or HTTP-NG).A Web server is the server that provides access to the Web resources. A Web page is the collection of Web resources that can be identified by an URI. If the Web page consists of n resources, the first n -1 are embedded into the nth URI, which identifies the Web page.

Mohanty Computer Science and Engineering University of North Texas, Denton, USA saraju.mohanty@unt.edu Abstract —The design process of smart Consumer Electronics (CE) devices heavily relies on reusable Intellectual Property (IP) cores of Digital Signal Processor (DSP) and Multimedia Processor (MP). On the other hand, due to strict competition and rivalry between IP vendors, the problem of ownership conﬂict and IP piracy is surging. Therefore, to design a secured smart CE device, protection of DSP/MP IP core is essential. Embedding a robust IP owner’s signature can protect an IP core from ownership abuse and forgery. This paper presents a covert signature embedding process for DSP/MP IP core at Register-transfer level (RTL). The secret marks of the signature are distributed over the entire design such that it provides higher robustness. For example for 8th order FIR ﬁlter, it incurs only between 6% and 3% area overhead for maximum and minimum size signature respectively compared to the non-signature FIR RTL design but with signiﬁcantly enhanced security. I. I NTRODUCTION In the design process of current smart Consumer Electronics devices, use of DSP and MP based reusable IP cores has become inevitable. The use of reusable DSP IP core decreases the design cycle immensely thus speeds up the design pro- ductivity [1]. The reason is that, once a DSP/MP IP core is designed with a certain speciﬁcation and technology for a smart CE device, the same IP core can be used for other CE devices which employ the same speciﬁcation and technology. For example, JPEG CODEC IP core for digital cameras can be reused in smart-phones or tablets. However, due to these advantages and strong market competition between IP vendors, DSP/MP IP cores are susceptible to major threats like unauthorized reuse and false claim of ownership [2], [3], [4], [5]. Therefore, to invalidate the ownership abuse and establish authorization, embedding owner’s secret mark (as signature) in the IP core design is vital. II. R ELATED PRIOR RESEARCH Secret mark for an IP core should be imperceptible and obscure in nature for an adversary. Moreover, it should not incur too much design overhead while preserving the correct functionality of an IP core. Few IP core ownership protection approaches for DSP cores during different phases of High- level Synthesis (HLS) are discussed in [6], [7], [8], [9]. In [6] a dual variable encoding scheme is proposed to embed secret mark for an IP core. In this approach, owner’s secret mark is embedded during register allocation phase of HLS. In [8], a input output mapping based IP core secret mark embeddingprocess is proposed. Both these approaches embed owner’s secret mark in single phase of HLS. In [7], a robust secret mark embedding approach is proposed, where the owner’s secret mark is embedded in three different phases of HLS. In [9] ownership protection for both the IP owner and IP user is also proposed. None of these approaches embeds owner’s secret mark during RTL. The beneﬁt of embedding owner’s secret mark during RT level is that the detection and authentication of signature for a genuine owner is simpler and less cumbersome compared to embedding at architecture level. Fig. 1 depicts the overview of possible attacks on a DSP/MP IP core and the proposed approach to shield it.

Overview of the possible threats and proposed approach. To advance the state-of-art in CE hardware ownership, in this paper, we propose a novel low-overhead, highly robust, secret signature embedding process to protect owner’s right in a DSP/MP IP core.

Speciﬁcally, we demonstrate improvements over prior approaches utilizing a compression-decompression network by introducing: (a) an edge-aware loss function to prevent blurring that is commonly occurred in prior works & (b) a super-resolution convolutional neural network (CNN) for post- processing along with a corresponding pre-processing network for improved rate-distortion performance in the low rate regime. The algorithm is assessed on a variety of datasets varying from low to high resolution namely Set 5, Set 7, Classic 5, Set 14, Live 1, Kodak, General 100, CLIC 2019. When compared to JPEG, JPEG2000, BPG, and recent CNN approach, the proposed algorithm contributes signiﬁcant improvement in PSNR with an approximate gain of 20.75%, 8.47%, 3.22%, 3.23% and 24.59%, 14.46%, 10.14%, 8.57% at low and high bit-rates respec- tively. Similarly, this improvement in MS-SSIM is approximately 71.43%, 50%, 36.36%, 23.08%, 64.70% and 64.47%, 61.29%, 47.06%, 51.52%, 16.28% at low and high bit-rates respectively. With CLIC 2019 dataset, PSNR is found to be superior with approximately 16.67%, 10.53%, 6.78%, and 24.62%, 17.39%, 14.08% at low and high bit-rates respectively, over JPEG2000, BPG, and recent CNN approach. Similarly, the MS-SSIM is found to be superior with approximately 72%, 45.45%, 39.13%, 18.52%, and 71.43%, 50%, 41.18%, 17.07% at low and high bit- rates respectively, compared to the same approaches. A similar type of improvement is achieved with other datasets also.

I NTRODUCTION EVERY day an enormous amount of data is continuously transmitted and stored. Mostly the transmission happens through the web, and the images on the internet are of high resolution and larger in size. So to improve the efﬁcacy of the transmission and storage, reducing the size of these ﬁles is a compulsion and an issue of big concern. Hence, image compression is widely used for storage & transmission which aims at reducing the different types of redundancies present in the image. A higher compression ratio reduces the size of the image to be stored as bits-per-pixel (bpp) allotted decreases, but it heavily affects the reconstruction quality of the image due to the loss that occurred during compression. So, there is a trade-off between the compression ratio and the quality of the image. Among alternative compression formats, the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) [1] standard is by-far D.

K. Singh, K. Preetham are with the Department of Information Tech- nology, Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad, Prayagraj (sk.singh@iiita.ac.in, krishna.preetham09@gmail.com)dominant; currently, almost all pictorial images are stored and communicated in JPEG format. Given the extensive utilization of JPEG, modern SmartPhone & tablet devices commonly include hardware support for JPEG compression & decom- pression. Methods that can improve compression performance, while maintaining compatibility with the JPEG format, are, therefore, of strong research interest. Theoretically, JPEG, the standard algorithm, which is a discrete cosine transform (DCT) based emphasizes low-frequency components while processing the image for the task of image compression. JPEG2000 [2], on the other hand, being lossless & lossy both, is a region of interest (ROI) based compression scheme based on multi- scale decomposition into sub-bands through discrete wavelet transform (DWT). As compared to JPEG, JPEG2000 produces only ringing effects near the edges in the image. However, at high bit-rates, these artifacts become less visible or almost imperceptible. Later on, many techniques like BPG1& WebP2 came into existence which provided a signiﬁcant quantitative & qualitative improvement with respect to reconstructed image quality. Nowadays, deep learning is producing interesting & eye-catching results in the ﬁeld of biometrics & computer vision, it has started proving itself in the image compression domain also. Some of the best compression algorithms are discussed in the next sections. A. Deblocking and Post-processing methods Various post-processing modules have been proposed in the literature. Modeling of the image-prior, based on maximum a posteriori (MAP) criteria is used in [3], but it is found to be quite more expensive than handcrafted models. The post-processing method in [4] based on the adaptive DCT method is quite good, but failed to generate sharp images. The notion of Wiener ﬁltering for denoising used in [5] was novel, however, the images generated contained highly visible noise at the edge regions. Similarly, the modeling of image prior and quantization is found to be expensive in [6]. Ren et al. [7] combined the local sparsity image prior model and non-local similarity model for artifacts reduction using low-rank minimization and patch clustering proposed in [3] and [6] respectively. Dictionary learning and variational regularization used in [8] for restoring images outperformed the other decompression method but consumed substantial computational time. Weighted nuclear norm minimization (WNNM) concept used in [9] being complex, outperformed Dabov et al. [5] approach while preserving the local structure and reducing visual artifacts taking more computation time. 1https://bellard.org/bpg/ 2https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/arXiv:2104.04926v1 [eess.IV] 11 Apr 2021",this work has been submitted to ieee for possible publication 1,this work has been submitted to ieee for possible publication 1

We know that the medical images used for disease diagnosis are around multiple gigabytes size, which is quite huge. The proposed residual-based dual autoencoder network is trained to extract the unique features which are then used to reconstruct the original image through the decompressor module. The two latent space representations (ﬁrst for the original image and second for the residual image) are used to rebuild the ﬁnal original image. Color-SSIM has been exclusively used to check the quality of the chrominance part of the cell images after decompression. The empirical results indicate that the proposed work outperformed other neural network related compression technique for medical images by approximately 35%, 10% and 5% in PSNR, Color SSIM and MS-SSIM respectively. The algorithm exhibits a signiﬁcant improvement in bit savings of 76%, 78%, 75% & 74% over JPEG-LS, JP2K-LM, CALIC and recent neural network ap- proach respectively, making it a good compression-decompression technique. Index Terms —lossy image compression, convolutional neural network, deep learning based, whole slide images (WSI), autoen- coder, residual, encoder-decoder, compression-decompression, RBM I. I NTRODUCTION DEEP learning techniques are now mostly used for diverse applications in image classiﬁcation, object detection, and segmentation task. Rapid development in this ﬁeld is made possible with the help of fast computing GPU resources. With the advancement in resources, image compression researchers are also diving and digging for these deep architectures available to date to accomplish the task of image compres- sion [1]–[4]. Applying the principle of exploiting domain knowledge of image processing with the deep neural network architectures, proved to be better for image compression over conventional pre-deep learning era algorithms. The traditional image compression algorithms were dependent on transform and quantization analysis, and among them, mostly are lossy in nature. Mostly the researchers are conﬁned to lossy image compression due to various constraints of quality distortion and limitations on compression ratio. In the medical ﬁeld, pathologists used to diagnose diseases by analyzing large images using a recently developed imaging technique calledWhole Slide Imaging (WSI) [5], [6]. WSI is a process to scan the glass slides to produce a digital slide. These images provide higher resolution and features in multi layers to extract very minute and ﬁne details. The size of these images ranges from many gigabytes, which need a lot of storage and transmission bandwidth. So, there is an alarming need for highly efﬁcient lossless image compression algorithms to compress information-rich images like medical images. For compressing these images, lossy compression for these whole slide images can affect the diagnosis process due to the information loss. Therefore, lossless image compression is the optimal approach to preserve relevant information in the images where any type of data loss is not acceptable; for example, medical images, satellite images, or images to be sent to army war ﬁeld areas. JPEG 2000 [7], being lossless and lossy both, is a region of interest (ROI) based compression scheme involving multi-band decomposition through discrete wavelet transform (DWT). ROI implies that the different parts of the image can be encoded with variable bit rates providing variable image qualities. The uniqueness of this compression scheme is its ﬂexibility of scalable or progressive decoding in resolution and quality based on the availability of the receiver system data rate (related to different com- pression ratios based on different bit-rate suitability). Due to this property, the encoder and decoder employed in its architecture are quite complicated and costly. Speciﬁcally, for lossless compression, the best available technique in literature is JPEG in lossless mode (JPEG-LS) [8], a prediction based effective approach based on a median edge detector (MED) with an additional entropy coding technique namely Golomb Rice Encoding (GRC) [9]. Context adaptive lossless image compression (CALIC) [10] was also heavily employed in literature based on the gradient adjusted predictor (GAP). It is based on MANIAC (Meta-Adaptive Near-zero Integer Arith- metic Coding), a context-adaptive method based on growing decision trees. Edge directed predictor (EDP) [11] was another approach which is optimized with least square techniques. In 2014, Hesabi et al. [12] exploited principle component analysis (PCA) [13] to learn the relationship between input samples and compressed representation to learn cross-image correlation. In [12], PCA was exploited to reduce the inter and intra image redundancies. The method outperformed JP2K-LM 978-0-7381-1151-3/20/$31.00 ©2020 IEEEarXiv:2108.10579v1 [eess.IV] 24 Aug 2021",dipti mishra satish kumar singhy and rajat kumar singhz,dipti mishra satish kumar singhy and rajat kumar singhz

Medical Image Analysis Medical image analysis [1] is the thorough processing and analysis of the medical related images belonging to a patient’s body for its diagnosis and effective treatment of any diseases or abnormalities. With the rise of AI based Deep learning, the complex process has become smoother and effective as now the images are being fed directly into the digital system a nd systematic scanning and analysis are being done for the extraction of relevant features in order to detect and localize the abnormalities inside patient’s body which is achieved through a specialized algorithms and trained models. This has made the job of healthcare experts easier and efficient. Figure 1 shows some of the applications of Deep Learning in the f ield of Medical Image Processing [2] . Figure 1 Medical Image Analysis B. Deep Learning Deep learning is an advanced version of machine learning that has taken the popularity and productivity of AI to the next level. In recent times, deep learning has played a significant role in the area of medical image analysis pertinent to the task of image classification, segmentation, pattern recognition, object detection, etc., proving nearby optimum results. Deep learning algorithms like Auto-encoders, RBMs, Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Generative Adversial networks (GANs) are some of the most widely used architectures being applied in medical analysis job. CNNs are undoubtedly the most preferred choice for performing the image classification tasks, which was first introduced in the year 1989 by LeCun. C. Content layout Section two of this manuscript briefs us about the various operations being performed on medical imaging data like segmentation, detection, registration and classifications, along with their sub-types.

OPERATIONS IN MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS A. Segmentation: Image segmentation [9] a technique where a medical image is being partitioned into multiple segments through the creation of a visual representation of an image pixel-wise so as to extract some relevant information from it and using only those portions of the information for further processing, that would not only increase the overall efficiency of the algorithm but also save computational time and cost. There are two types of image segmentation: - 1) Organ Segmentation : - The segmentation of entire organ or substructure where a segmented mask is obtained for the region of interest using volume or shape as important parameters.

Introduction Recent years have witnessed use of information in many areas including financial accounts, military and political. Security of this information in both storage and transit is crucial as it may be compromised resulting in financial loss, disclosure of military or commercial secrets, and even theloss of life. Cryptography is one set of techniques for pro-viding information security. Historically, cryptography iscommonly connected with surveillance, warfare, and thesimilarapplications.However,withtheadventofinformationcivilizationanddigitalrevolution,cryptographyisalsousefulin the peaceful lives of common people, for example, whenbuying something over the Internet through credit card,withdrawing money from the ATM machines using smart-cards,andlockingandunlockingluxurycars. Cryptography is related to the design of cryptosystems. Cryptosystemshavetwodivisions:symmetrickeyandasym-metric key. In the case of symmetric-key cryptosystem,encryptionfunctiontakesatextmessage(plaintext)asinputand transforms it into an unreadable text (ciphertext) withthe use of a secret key [1]. The decryption function convertsthe ciphertext back to the plaintext using the same secretkey. If any flaws or oversights exist in the cryptosystem, itcanbeexploitedbytheattacker[1].Theattackercanrecovertheplaintextfromtheciphertextwithoutknowingthesecretkey because of openness of cryptographic algorithms andthe encrypted data transfers via the insecure public com-munication channel.

This is usually done ‘by hand’, taking several days or week of iterative repair and after feedback from students complaining that the time table is unfair to them in some way. Which we in this research tried solving through conventional method (Result shows that the pr oblem of conventional method) but at a certain level we recognized that solving timetabling problem with increased constraints is very difficult by conventional methods. A high ly constrained combinatorial problem, timetabling can also be solved by evolutionary techniques. In this research we are showing evolutionary based genetic algorithm approach as an effective solution to solve course timetabling problem. Index Terms —Genetic Algorithms, Meta-heuristic, Course Timetabling . I. INTRODUCTION A timetable is a set of meetings in time. A meeting is combination of resources (rooms, people etc), some of which is specified by problem and some of which may be allocated as part of solution. Our ai m is to schedule teachers and classes to fully utilize available resources. This is done by assigning correct time and place to appropriate event hence timetable must be designed to satisfy all user requirements or else it would be a waste of time and requirements. In course timetabling the hard constraint will be that at a time lecturer cannot take lecture in two different classes and after each lecture at least one lecture relaxation should be given to the lecturer. Timetabling constraints are many and varied. In this research, genetic algorithm approach is applied for solving university course timetabling problem. GA is a way of addressing hard search and optimization problems which provides a good solution although it requires large execution time. In section 2 we represent the formulation of the lecture timetable problem, experiments which we have done represented in section 3 and in section 4 formulation of genetic algorithm approach for solving course timetabling problem is discussed in detail. Section 5 presents the result of several experiments conducted using conventional methods, 1Reader, Department of Computer Science, Truba college of Engineering & Tech., Indore, India 2Director, KCB Technical Academy, Indore 3Group Director, Truba group of institutes, Indore Email:ashishjn.research@gmail.com, suresh.jain@rediffmail.com,pkchan dein@yahoo.co.in followed by conclusion in section 6. II. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION The timetables to be treated in this paper are constructed for the two year courses like M.B.A. for Devi Ahilya University, Indore. The course is divided into semesters (for fall semester: semester 1 & semester 3 and for spring semester: semester 2 & semester 4). There are 7 time periods within a day and each time period consists of a 50 minutes. In every semester the course cont ains 8 theoretical subjects one of which contains laboratory work also. Each subject should be allocated 4 time periods in a week along with 2 time periods for laboratory work. A. Problem D efinition Given the participants consisting of lecture timetable: k lecturers l 1, l2 ,l3,.…l k and m classes c 1, c2, c3,….c m, with r courses s 1, s2, s3,....s r q rooms r 1, r2, r3…r q and n periods p 1, p2, p3,…p n Where an assignment is a 5 tuple<l, c, s, r, p> [1]. B. Constraints Involved The constraints that we treat ar e classified as hard and soft. Hard constraints are those to which a time table has to adhere in order to be satisfied. Hard constraints involved are: 1) No participant (lecturer or cla ss) can be in more than two rooms at the same period. 2) No room should be double booked. 3) The room capacity should be large enough to hold each class. Violating the above constraints will cause the time table to be unfeasible. In addition, we would also like to satisfy as many soft constraints as possible in order to produce a good quality timetable. Soft constraints for this constrained optimization problem are actually the students and lectures preferences which can be as follows. 1) The second time for each subject should not be in the same day. 2) No subject should be allocated to a time period that heads of department don’t demand because of other work. • The subject should not be allocated to a time period inconvenient for a lecturer.

Recom mender systems are intelligent web applications whi ch generate recommendations keeping in view the user’s stated and unstated requirements. Evolutionary approaches like Genetic and memetic algorithms have been considered as one of the most successful approaches for combinatorial optimization. Memetic Algorithms (MAs) are enhanced genetic algorithms which incorporate local search in the evolutionary scheme. Local Search process on each solution after every generation helps in improving the convergence time of MA. This paper presents multi-perspective comparative evaluation of memetic and genetic evolu tionary algorithms for model based collaborative filtering recommender system. Experimental study wa s conducted on MovieLens dataset to investigate the decision support and statistical efficiency of Meme tic and genetic algorithms. Algorithms were analyze d from different perspectives like variation in numbe r of clusters, effect of increasing the number of u sers, varying number of recommendations and using either one or more than one cluster for computing ratings of the unrated items. Results obtained demonstrated that from all perspectives memetic collaborative filtering algorithm has better predictive accuracy as compared genetic collaborative filtering algorit hm.

INTRODUCTION The explosion of information on World Wide Web has led to the development of intelligent web applications. These applications take into consider ation heterogeneity of sources, user interests and mobility to intelligently utilize vast, rich an d shared web resources and services available on the web. Examples of such web applications include Web Personalization, Web Mining, Semantic Web and Intelligent Agents etc. However in recent years, adaptive/personalized web applications popularly known as recommender systems have become more trendy. These systems try to identify the traits of the active user and t hen provide suggestions based on either the users personal past history or on the basis of opinions o f friends, relatives and peers etc to facilitate their decisions. Among the various techniques used to develop the recommender systems, collaborative filtering, content based filtering an d hybrid techniques are more common [1]. Other filtering techniques include Demographic filtering which uses demographic information like age, gender, qualification, etc. of the users to make re commendations. Utility based recommender systems suggest items based on their usefulness for the users. Knowledge based recommender systems take advantage of the knowledge about how a particular item meets a particular user needs, to make recommendations.

It is often felt that the concept of e-learning can be successfully applied to theoretical sub- jects but when it comes to teaching of science subjects like chemistry where hands on practical training is must, it is inadequate. This chapter presents a hybrid approach (amalgamation of concepts of machine learning technique with soft computing paradigm) to develop an intelligent virtual chemistry laboratory (IVCL) tool for simulating chemical experiments online. Tool presents an easy to use web based interface, which takes as input the reactants and presents results in the form of - type of reaction occurred and the list of possible products. Technically, the IVCL tool utilizes naïve bayes algorithm to classify the type of reactions and then applies genetic algorithm inspired approach to generate the products. Subsequently it employs system of equations method to balance the reactions. Experimental evaluations reveal that proposed IVCL tool runs with 95% accuracy. 1. INTRODUCTION The emergence of Internet and information technologies has given an unprecedented boost to e-learning. Learning over internet has added a new dimension to traditional education system. It has enabled the learners to not only access the educational resources across the globe but also interact with others and engage in effective and attractive learning experiences (Welsh et al., 2003).

The existing algorithms for community detection depend chieﬂy on the network topologies and are not effective for such sparse graphs. Thus, there is a great need to optimize those algorithms. Evolutionary algorithms have emerged as a promising solution for optimized approximation of hard problems. We propose to optimize the community detection method based on modularity and normalized mutual information (NMI) using the latest grey wolf optimization algorithm. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms, when compared with other contemporary evolutionary algorithms. Keywords Community detection • Grey wolf optimization • Modularity • NMI 1 Introduction Humans have always preferred to live in society by making groups to form small or big communities. The communities could evolve based on race, colour, caste, religion, gender, job category, interest, hobbies etc. Nowadays, with the rapid advancement in the speed of the Internet a nd its reduced cost, we try to socialize through social networks, despite being separated by long distances across the globe. This has been made possible because of the social networks available to us. These networks have become the backbone of virt ual socialization and help people to interact and share their latest updates with their friends and relatives. Thus, social S.

Introduction The amount of data that has been created within the past 2 years is larger than the entire previous history of the human race. Data is growing quicker than ever before and ac cording to IDC amount of data created *Corresponding author. Email address: mehtshikha@gmail.com Janardan, Dr.Shikha Mehta/ Procedia Computer Science 00 (2017) 000–000 annually is expected to reach 18 0 zettabytes in 2025[1]. Data never sleeps; immense amount of data is being generated from diverse applications across the internet in ever y 60 seconds [2]. Every minute Google receives over 2,000,00 search queries and email users send 204166,667 me ssages. It is noticed that a massive growth in video data, where every minute up to 300 hours of videos are up loaded to YouTube alone [3]. These facts indicate the speed with which dat a is growing thereby forming t he digital universe. Speed or velocity is one of the main characteristic of big data. Technological advancement in hardware is also responsible for rising popularity of data streams [4]. Many simple operations of every day life, such as using a credit/debit card or smart phone, often lead to automated creation of data. Since th ese operations often scale over large numbers of participants, they lead to massive data streams. Similarly, tel ecommunications and social networks often contain large amounts of images, audio, video and text data str eams. Mining data streams has now become major challenge for the research community as the data mining a lgorithms developed so far are more suitable for stationary data. Since the data itself is changing or evolv ing over time and is available only for very short duration, learning from data streams is another big challenge.T he temporal properties (real time data generation) of data streams differentiate it from non-streaming data and he nce derive the need for novel classification, clustering, pattern mining techniques and performance evaluatio n parameters. This paper focus on the problem of classification in data stream s. Classical classification alg orithms are not compatible with streaming data due to resource constraints (processing time, memory) and single sc an of the data (one look, no random access) [47]. Therefore, to create new le arning approaches like increme ntal or ensemble learning to classify the streaming data is another research issue. Classification of str eaming data is not as simple as the classification on stationary data because the dis tribution of the dataset may change over the time during the training of model. This phenomenon is referred to as concept drift. All streaming models need to account for concept drift in the model construction process. Therefore, the construction of a training model in streaming and evolving scenarios is often very critical. Research in this direction has started gaining more attention i n the recent past due to the mushrooming size of data.Gaber et al [5] presented an overview of generalstream mining algorithms. A survey by Gama and Rodrigues [6] focused on illustrating data stream mining with s pecific algorithms and applications. In recent survey papers, Hai-Long Nguyen et al. [7] and BakshiRohitPrasad et al. [8] discussed supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms for streaming data along with some available platforms to handle streaming data. However, these researchersmainly focus on classification and clustering algorithms in general and do not cover the specific problem with classification algorithms i.e. concept drift. This paper presentssimplified categorization of the different types of algorithms, platformsa nd performance metrics for classification in streaming data, which are commonly used in the literature along with novel algorithms for classification which deal with concept drift problem. Therefore, this paper provides a road map for the researchers who intend to develop new algorithms for solvi ng concept drift problem in cla ssification. This work is also intended to aid the mining community who wish to utilize existing concept drift ada pted stream mining algorithms for classifications in diverse domains. Rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduce s theconcept drift problem in classification and major issues of classification in drifted data. In section 3, c ategorization of classification algorithms which deals with concept drift is presented. Section 4 provides the d etails of available tools and dataset for the classification of streaming data. Section 5 discusses performan ces evaluators for classification under concept drift followed by future challenges and conclusion. 2. Concept drift in streaming data classification In streaming data classification there is an infinite seque nce of the form (x,y) where y={y1, y2, …, yk}, and the goal is to find a function y=f(x) that can predict the y va lue for an unseen instance x, where the size of dataset is not known due to evolving nature of streaming data.

In today’s era, organizations are developing applications which continuously and rapidly generates large amount of data. In this world of big data, NoSQL databases are rapidly becoming popular for storing information among organizations. Therefore, it is essential for an organization to choose a database which is compatible and eﬃcient for their applications. To choose a correct data‐ base, it is essential to examine the performance of various databases under diverse workload conditions. In this paper, we are examining diﬀerent document oriented databases on various workloads, so that we can categorize them according to application need. The evaluation has been performed on four NoSQL document oriented databases: MongoDB, ArangoDB, Elastic search and OrientDB with the help of Yahoo Cloud Service Benchmark (YCSB), which is a popular benchmark tool. Comparison is done in two parts: In the ﬁrst part, all the databases are compared for single thread on the basis of throughput and runtime. Here, Mongo DB shows better results with highest throughput and lowest runtime among all the databases. In the second part, a thorough analysis is done in which MongoDB and ArangoDB are compared for some threads on diﬀerent workloads. Here also, Mongo DB outperforms ArangoDB with a high percentage. Keywords: Big data · MongoDB · ArangoDB · OrientDB · Elastic search Document oriented databases · YCSB 1 Introduction 1.1 A Subsection Sample Big data is a term used for large and complex datasets that cannot be processed with the traditional data processing software. Analysis of these large datasets is relevant in ﬁnding patterns, spotting trends, preventing cr ime and enhancing user experience. To manage this big data NoSQL databases are designed. NoSQL databases are those data‐ bases which provides the mechanism of storing data in key-value, wide column, graph, document rather than storing data in tabular form as in relational databases. It is also called “Not only SQL”. It uses data structures that are faster in terms of relational data‐ bases. Examples of NoSQL databases are: Riak, Couchbase, MongoDB, Cassandra, HBase, Neo4j, OrientDB, etc. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018 B. Panda et al.

This inspires the researchers to work in the area of infor- mation diffusion, i.e., spread of information through “word of mouth” effect. Infor- mation maximization is an important research problem of information diffusion, i.e., selection of kmost inﬂuential nodes in the network such that they can maxi- mize the information spread. In this paper, we proposed an inﬂuence maximization model that identiﬁes optimal seeds to maximize the inﬂuence spread in the network. Our proposed algorithm is a hybrid approach, i.e., GA with k-medoid approach using dynamic edge strength. To analyze the efﬁciency of the proposed algorithm, experiments are performed on two large-scale datasets using ﬁtness score measure. Experimental outcome illustrated 8–16% increment in inﬂuence propagation by pro- posed algorithm as compared to existing seed selection methods, i.e., general greedy, random, discounted degree, and high degree.

Social net- work is becoming tremendously substantial for various applications, i.e., educational, matrimony Web sites, government division, job search portals, recommendation sys- tem [ 1], health care, viral marketing [ 2], and numerous other businesses. In all these applications, Social network is commonly considered as a platform for information propagation in network, i.e., social inﬂuence. In online social networks, activities of S.

It enhances the compu- tation capabilities of mobile nodes and IoT (Internet of Things) devices by providing compute and storage capabilities similar to the cloud but at a lower latency and using lesser bandwidth. Additional advantages of fog computing include its support for node mobility, context awareness, reliability and scalability. Due to its multiple beneﬁts, fog computing is used for ofﬂoading tasks from applications executing on end devices. This allows faster execution of applications using the capabilities of fog nodes. However, the task ofﬂoading problem in the fog environment is chal- lenging due to the dynamic nature of fog environment and multiple QoS (Quality of Service) parameters dependent on the application being executed. Therefore, the chapter proposes a QoS-aware task ofﬂoading strategy using a novel nature-inspired optimization algorithm, known as the Smart Flower Optimization Algorithm (SFOA). The proposed strategy takes into account the QoS parameters such as the task dead- lines and budget constraints in selection of appropriate fog nodes where computation tasks can be ofﬂoaded. The proposed strategy has been simulated and the results have veriﬁed the efﬁcacy of the strategy.

Recently, Textual Entailment (TE) has been successfully employed to measure sentence connectedness in order to determine sentence salience in single document text summarization. In literature, Analog Textual Entailment and Spectral Clustering (ATESC) is one such method which has used TE to compute inter -sentence connectedness scores. These scores are used to compute salience of sentences and are further utilize d by Spectral Clustering algorithm to create segments of sentences. Finally, the most salient sentences are extracted from the most salient segments for inclusion in the final summary. The method has shown good performance earlier. But the authors observe that TE has never been employed for the task of multi -document summarization. Therefore, this paper has proposed ATESC based new methods for the same task. The experiments conducted on DUC 2003 and 2004 datasets reveal that the notion of Textual Entailment along with Spectral Clustering algorithm proves to be an effective duo for redundancy removal and generating informative summaries in multi -document summarization. Moreover, the proposed methods have exhibited faster execution times.

INTRODUCTION The technological advancements in the ever -growing digital world have brought a flood of information in t he present society. This flow of superfluous information is adversely affecting the efficiency of a human brain. The stress induced by the reception of more information than a brain can comprehend directly interferes with its decision -making capabilities. It causes reading fatigue and wastage of time, thus adversely affecting the productivity of an individual. At an organizational level, where time and employee brain is an expensive resource, this situation has a negative impact on end results ultimately. T his phenomenon of information overload has led to the need for information extraction tools which can provide the user with the relevant information without the need of going through the whole pool of information. The automatic text summarization seems to be a good and viable solution to this problem. Automatic text summarization is an important task of condensing a single text document or multiple text documents into a short excerpt of sentences conveying the gist of the whole text. This condensed version of the original document is called summary. A summary should cover maximum significant information of the source document so that it w ould be worthwhile for a reader to go through it. Moreover, it should cover all the sub -topics of the source document. At the outset, it is required to capture connectivity - based relationships among sentences of the source document so that those related under common sub -topics could be brought together. In literature, ATESC [1] is one such method which has been well utilized for the same purpose. The paper has reported the effectiveness of the ATESC method in the task of single document text summarization. The method has performed well on Essay type and long articles. The essence of ATESC lies in creating a summary which cove rs all the significant themes. The sentence salience detection criteria and sentence clustering method used beneath the ATESC method are based on the concept of text connectedness which facilitates to cluster sentences that are connected under relevant the mes. However, the authors have observed some limitations in ATESC method regarding determining entailment scores and sentence scoring, which need to be addressed in order to",published online april 2019 in mecs (http: www mecs -press org ),published online april 2019 in mecs (http: www mecs -press org )

One of the prime aims is to convert today’s web of documents into a web of data where the data is machine-readable as well as processable. This research paper focuses on the data mining techniques used for mining the raw data. However, these techniques are cumbersome and can be optimized using Linked Data. Hence, we discuss the data mining techniques with Linked Data that may play a pivotal role in future in extracting meaningful information from unstructured or semi-structured data. Keywords- Data Mining; Social Media Data Mining; Linked Data; Web of Data; KDD I. INTRODUCTION In every decade, the size of the storage devices shrinks, yet capacity increases dramatically. Due to the rapid advancement in data storage t echnologies, we are able to store an enormous amount of data [1]. Every day new and more data is uploaded over the web. However, this vast amount of data is useless without any fast and reliable method to process it. Data processing is a problem in itself. Obtaining useful information from large datasets is becoming a growing concern. As the volume of data increases, so is the ambiguity. Extracting relevant information would be easier if the data to be processed is available in a structured form. However, that does not happen in most of the cases. Mostly, one has to deal with unstructured or semi-structured data. For e.g. most of the data available on the web is in the form of HTML documents. HTML documents contain texts, audio, video, pictures, links, tables, etc. which are displayed by the web- browsers. Thus, making it difficult for computers to extract useful information from such plain text documents. Nowadays, for extracting meaningful information from unstructured or semi-structured data, data mining techniques are used very frequently. Therefore, this research article examines data mining techniques which are currently being practiced. However, traditional data mining techniques work well only with isolated data sets. Hence, we also discuss the data mining techniques with Linked Data that may play a pivotal role in future in extracting meaningful information from unstructured or semi-structured data. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II discusses about data mining and its needs followed by section III which talks about data mining with Linked Data; section IV elaborates about knowledge discovery followed by section V that converses about data mining through API. Additionally, section VI expounds about mining the web of Linked Data with tools; section VII discusses about semantic proximity with Linked Data. Section VIII concludes the research article. II. DATA MINING & ITS NEEDS ""Data mining is the practice of automatically searching large storage of data to discover patterns and trends that go beyond simple analysis. Data mining uses sophisticated mathematical algorithms to segment the data and evaluate the probability of future events. Data mining is also known as Knowledge Discovery in Data (KDD)"" [2]. For e.g., data mining aims to build a knowledge base which contains information that may even be useful to small businesses like local restaurants and stores for marketing purposes. The information posted on social networking sites can prove to be very useful to these local businesses. Users' comments sometimes include their views and opinions on places they visit and whether they had a good or bad experience. The problem arises because these comments and posts are available in plaintext and not in formal languages. To resolve above problem, text mining techniques are required. They are used to extract useful information and keywords, and then can be converted to the formal knowledge database. Comments are analyzed for the name of the businesses, positive or negative feedback. Other information about users like age, gender, location, etc. is extracted which might give business owners additional input while coming up with marketing strategies. Further challenges may be filtering out fake reviews which are paid by business owners to make sure that they are positive. Information can be old or inconsistent. Fortunately, there is a newer approach which is reliable, unambiguous and more efficient where we use Semantic Web to describe relationships and link isolated datasets.

The need to adapt to this new reality is obvious and is bound to have a long lasting influence on the software industry. This fosters the industry and researchers to look for intelligent sup - porting technologies and tools that can help interconnect and exchange Software Engineering knowledge. A rising trend to exploit ontologies for sharing and reusing information across web is well recognized. We examine the strategic alignment of ontologies to Software Engineering where the former can be used to improve and assist in intelligent software development process. The SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis is presented giving an insight to the use of ontologies to enrich and enhance Software Engineering processes. *Author for correspondence1. Introduction “Semantic Web provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application, enterprise, and community boundaries”1. It is a machine processable “Web of Data”2. Semantic Web stack illustrates the architecture of the Semantic Web that encompasses of several languages or technologies. At the core of architec - ture is “Ontology, which is an explicit, formal specification of shared conceptualization”3. Ontologies are used to represent abstract model, where a domain is fixed with identified relevant concepts and relationship among those concepts. Ontology engineering in Semantic Web is prin - cipally supported by languages such as XML, RDF, RDFS and OWL4.

Formally, Software Engineering is “the applica - tion of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software, and the study of these approaches; that is, the applica - tion of engineering to software”5. Software development is a multifaceted participative and collaborative task that comprises a lot of effort from various participants and yields considerable amount of information. Reusing extant pertinent information saves significant effort during the development and maintenance of software sys - tem. Moreover, according to the recent IT Outsourcing Statistics 2015/ 2016 report by Computer Economics6 in 2015, around 62% of the Application development work has been outsourced either entirely or in part by IT organizations and in the past 5 years, over 60% of com - panies outsourced their application development work.

If cybersecurity is prevention then cyber forensics is the cure. Both are equally important pillars of digital security. This paper presents an extensive bibliometric analysis of cybersecurity and cyberforensic research published in Web of Science during the past decade (2011–2021). The analysis included yearly publications, publication types and trends across different verticals such as publishing sources, organizations, researchers, countries and keywords. Full counting method was used for citation analysis, whereas fractional counting method was implemented to analyze co-citation, co-author col- laborations as well as keyword co-occurrences across all these verticals. Furthermore, timeline and burst detection analyses were carried out to unravel significant topic trends and citations in the last decade. The study presents bibliometric results in terms of the authors, organizations, countries, keywords, sources and documents with the highest collaborative link strengths worldwide in the field of cybersecurity and forensics. Latest trends, under-investigated topics and future directions are also presented. 1. Introduction Cyberattacks on the host computer’s information and services are hostile operations that aim to interrupt, degrade, deny or corrupt essential information and services. Cybersecurity refers to the various defense mechanisms employed to safeguard against such attacks. Cyber forensics refers to the science of data recovery and attack tracing after an attack event. A lot of time and effort is required by conventional security software to identify and categorize potential/new threats and encode these categorizations in order to detect such attacks in the future. Using machine learning techniques, this time-intensive procedure may be made more efficient. Therefore, various machine learning techniques were created to identify assaults more rapidly and accurately [1]. Cyber security and forensics is a serious issue across all industries and sectors because of the prevalence and rapid expansion of computer systems and internet capabilities. Higher education is also increasingly facing such dangers. There have been reports of data breaches at universities as a result of cyber-attacks. Higher education users employ portable gadgets that allow them to be extremely mobile. These gadgets enable students to become acclimated to networking, allowing them to connect to the unsecured networks at any time and from any device. As a result of the openness and simple access to data and information, cyber security is particularly difficult to implement in higher educational institutions [2]. Inadequate cyber security exposes higher education to ∗Corresponding author. E-mail addresses: deepak.btg@gmail.com (D. Sharma), ruchi.mittal138@gmail.com (R. Mittal), ravi.sekhar@sitpune.edu.in (R.

Many researchers may analyz e the cryptocurrency features in several ways such as market price prediction, the impact of cryptocurrency in real life and so on. In this paper, we focus on market price prediction of the number of cryptocurrencies based on their historical trend. For ou r study, we tried to understand and identify the daily trends in the cryptocurrency market which analyzing the features related to the price of cryptocurrency. Our dataset consists of over nine features relating to the cryptocurrency price recorded daily o ver the period of 6 months. We applied some machine -learning algorithms to predict the daily price change of cryptocurrencies. Keywords: Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, Decentraliza tion, Network, Price Prediction 1. INTRODUCTION The exponential growth of Internet access has triggered new technologies and techniques in real life [6]. Cryptocurrency is one of the emerging Internets technology uses as currency over the traditional monetary system [2]. The term cryptocurrency means the digital currency or the virtual currency, which is works as a mode of exchange or transfer of assets digitally. The market of cryptocurrency has evolved at an exponential speed in a short span of time. The first cryptocurrency was introduced in 2009 name d as Bitcoin by Satoshi Nakamoto [1]. Later on, there are thousands of other cryptocurrencies are running in the market. Unlike centralized banking system and electronic money, cryptocurrencies follow the decentralized system, which means it supports block chain transactional databases [2 ] [4]. The centralized banking system means there is the hierarchy of network exist and government controls the overall currency system, on the other hand, there is no hold of government or any other agency exists on cryptoc urrencies [5]. A sample blockchain is shown in Fig.1. Fig.1. Cryptocurrency workflow using blockchain mechanism Digital coins or cryptocurrencies are named so due to the use of encryption techniques in regulating transfers creation of coins. It is essent ial to understand the social and financial factors that determine the price of a bitcoin so that we can understand its impact on the economy of a nation. Bitcoin as well as other cryptocurrencies have not gone down well with governments due to avoidance of financial systems and increased impossibility to allow cash movements and fight against activities that are not legal. These include the decision of Chinese government to get rid of Bitcoins in 2013, the bankruptcy of Mt. Gox which is one of the heads of Bitcoin trading and gain legitimacy after Brexit vote. These and many other issues have led to the need of studying about digital currencies intensely. In this paper, we are predicting daily price changes for multiple cryptocurrencies. A few of them are bi tcoin, ripple, NMC and so on. We propose an approach for the price prediction using one of the famous machine learning algorithms, i.e. multivariate linear regression. Our plan starts with data pre - processing, in which we clean up the dataset by removing r ows with the missing value. Next, we examine the independent features in the dataset, which help us in predicting the highest price of the cryptocurrency. Next we find out the correlation between dependent and independent variables, and at last, we can predict the costs. Paper outline: In section 2 we discuss the related work in the area of cryptocurrencies’ price prediction. In section 3, we present our approach or methodology followed for the price prediction. In section 4, we discuss our dataset briefly , and in section 5, we discuss our experimental results. 2. RELATED WORK Authors have described the working of Bitcoin in [6]. Unlike traditional payment systems dominated by US dollar, Bitcoin has its metric value called bitcoin. A bitcoin’s value is derived from its use for making payments in the Bitcoin system. Authors have questioned the economists on whether bitcoins meet standard attributes of money or not [7]. As shown in Fig.2, these nodes or entities signify the payments made using Bitcoin [8]. These entities make transactions directly and do not need any central banks or networks. Every transaction is recorded chronologically in a blockchain by the participants in this network. Participants in this network compete to get rewards which are obtained by recording transactions in the Bitcoin system. Each participant keeps a copy of the public ledger or blockchain, and a well -defined process is used to choose the winning participant. There is decentralization of verifications and transactions. The procedure of giving awards to participants leads to many economic incentives and thus drives the system of Bitcoin. The reward essentially includes a voluntary fee and fresh",ruchi mittal et al : automated cryptocurrencies prices prediction using machine learning,ruchi mittal et al : automated cryptocurrencies prices prediction using machine learning

It can also be termed e-learning, computer-based education, web-based learning, distance education, etc. Online education was initially conceptualized in asynchronous mode from Boston in 1728 through weekly letters. In 1922 the courses are broadcasted on radio as World War one opened opportunities for broadcasting. In 1953, television was used as the medium of education at the University of Houston. The origination of the internet and the World Wide Web opens up new prospects for universities and educational institutes for online education. In 1996 duke University started its first executive MBA program globally. In 2008 first MOOC (Massive Online Open Course) [1]was created and in 2012 Coursera, Udacity, and edX were also launched. The government of India has also taken many initiatives under the digital-India campaign to promote digital education. These are SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active Learning for Young Aspiring Minds), DIKSHA, e-PG Pathshaala, Swayam Prabha, National Digital Library of India (NDLI), E-Shod Sindhu, National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning (NPTEL), Virtual Labs, etc. Journal of Engineering Education Transformations , Volume 35 , No. 4 , April 2022 , ISSN 2349-2473, eISSN 2394-1707 Geeta Rani , Puninder Kaur , Taruna Sharma1 2 3 1geeta@chitkara.edu.in puninder.k@chitkara.edu.in2 taruna.sharma@chitkara.edu.in3 Geeta Rani geeta@chitkara.edu.in",abstract : online education is existing since 2014 but,abstract : online education is existing since 2014 but

It is an internet based service delivery model which provides internet based services, computing and storage for users in all market including financial, health care & government. In this paper we did systematic review on different types of clouds and the security challenges that should be solved. Cloud security is becoming a key differentiator and competitive edge between cloud providers. This paper discusses the security issues arising in different type of clouds. Keywords — Cloud, Security, Security challenges, Cloud computing I. INTRODUCTION The term “cloud” was coined from the computer networ k diagrams which uses it to hide the complexity of infrastructure involved. cloud computing provides software, platform and infrastructure as a service. its main features include resource pooling, rapid elasticity, measured service, on-demand self service and broad network access. so, a cloud is a collection of hardware and software that runs in a data centre and enables the cloud computing model. A cloud reduces capital investment, hardware cost and software licence cost. cloud computing also raises severe challenges especially regarding the security level required for the secure use of services provided by it. There are no publically available standards specific to cloud computing security. so, in this paper, we propose the following standards for maintaining security in an unsafe cloud computing environment. Main characteristics include;  On-demand self-service. The ability for an end user to sign up and receive • services without the long delays that have characterized traditional IT.  Broad network access. Ability to access the service via standard platforms • (desktop, laptop, mobile etc).

The group key agreement protocol enables to derive a shared sessio n key for the remote members to communicate securely. Recently, several attempts are made to utilize group key agreement protocols for s ecure multicasting in Internet of T hings. This paper contributes to identify the security vulnerabiliti es in the existing protocols, to avoid them in future constructi ons. The protocols presented by Gupta and Biswas have been found insecu re to ephemeral secret key leakage (ESL) attack and also, malici ous insiders can impersonate an honest participant.

The recent security concerns are prevailing when multiple devi ces over a wireless com- munication interact among them leaking sensitive information to a non- participating entity [20, 19]. A common concern in these real world applications is to establish a secure ses sion among the interested remote participants. It is always challenging to derive a shared secret key which can prev ail over the advantages of adversary. A group key agreement (GKA) protocol enables the participating members t o establish such a symmetric session key, usually following an asymmetric procedure. This symmetric key is further used for encryption decryption purpose. Various real life applications of GKA includes distributed computations, video conferencing and multi- user games. A variety of key establishment approaches have been prese nted in literature based on the network characteristics, agreement strategy, communication rounds and contribu tiveness. The two major classes repre- senting the protocols are either transportation of session key or agreeme nt via participant’s contribution. In the key transport protocols, the session key is derived by one of the powe rful nodes and then transferred securely to all the members of the group. The common session key, derived by all t he members following an interactive protocol, is known as key agreement protocols. The hybridization of above two categories can originate another variety of pr otocols namely, balanced and imbalanced protocols. The balanced protocols are equally contributi ve protocols while in imbalanced, all the participants contribute but the major part of computations, such as signature veriﬁcation, is performed by some powerful node. Other than preserving the basic attributes s uch as known key security and forward secrecy, contributiveness is an important aspect of a GKA protocol. By contributiveness, we mean t hat all the member’s contributions are involved so that none of the member can predetermine the session key without incorporation of other members. Following the Diﬃe and Hellman [8] work on two-party key exchange, there h as been extensive eﬀorts to convert their two-party key exchange protocol to multi-party key exc hange protocol [6, 11, 21]. Among the most notable works, Joux’s one round three-party key agreement protocol [ 13] is considered as a signiﬁcant contribution for practical GKA protocol due to the functionality of pair ing. Based on Joux’s work [13], Barua et al. [1] have presented protocols of multi-party key agreement in tw o ﬂavours unauthenticated - based on ternary trees and authenticated - from bilinear maps. Unfortunately their protocols are secure against pas sive adversaries only. As established by Bellare and Rogaway (Crypto’93) [2], t o avoid man in the middle (MITM) attack,authentication is an essential security requirement for key exchange protocols. The ﬁrst contribution towards modeling provable security for auth enticated key exchange (AKE), was commenced by Bresson et al. [3, 4, 5] but their protocol accounts O(n) rounds, which is very expensive. Later in 2003, Katz and Yung [15] presented a scalable compiler to transform any unau thenticated GKA into an authenticated GKA with the additional cost of one round. Since the GKA s tudy involves multiple participants, the consideration of malicious insider is a realistic scenario. Katz and Shin [14] ﬁrstly modeled the insider ∗Universit´ e Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium ( suman1005@gmail.com ) †Universit´ e Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium ‡Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida, India §Thapar University, India 93",volume 20 number 1 pp 93 99 http: www scpe orgdoi 10 12694 scpe v20i1 1440,volume 20 number 1 pp 93 99 http: www scpe orgdoi 10 12694 scpe v20i1 1440

We propose a new method of generating the fuzzy if-then rules speciﬁc to a given image based on the local information available to be used by a fuzzy inference system. To this end, we only generate a partial histogram and not a complete histogram thus saving on computational costs. We also give a compartive study of our approach and some clas- sical and existing fuzzy techniques, and show that the enhanced images from the proposed algorithm are comparable. Keywords:ImageEnhancement, ContrastStretch- ing, Fuzzy Inference Systems, Fuzzy Partition, His- togram Equalisation, Histogram Matching, Gray level transformations. 1. Image enhancement Enhancement is a fundamental task in digital image processing and analysis. Image enhancement seeks to improve the visual representation of an image to enhance its interpretability by either a human or a machine. Image enhancement encompasses a variety of operations such as noise removal, deblur- ring, gray-level dynamic range modiﬁcation. Con- trast enhancement is among them and is often part of image processing systems in the pre-processing and/or post-processing stage. The principal objective of enhancement is to pro- cessanimagesothattheresultismoresuitablethan the original image for a speciﬁc application. The word speciﬁc is more important, because a method that is quite useful for enhancing X-ray images may not necessarily be the best approach for enhancing natural sceneries. When an image is processed for visual interpretation, the viewer becomes the ulti- mate judge of how well a method works. 1.1. Spatial Domain Methods The term spatial domain refers to the set of all pix- els composing an image. Spatial domain methods are procedures that operate directly on these pix- els. Iff(x,y)denotes the input image and g(x,y) the processed image, the diﬀerent spatial domain procedures can be seen as an operator Tonfsuchthat g(x,y) =T[f(x/prime,y/prime)], (x/prime,y/prime)∈N(x,y),(1) whereN(x,y)is some neigbhourhood of the point(x,y ). Usually, a neighborhood about a point (x,y)istakentobethesquareorrectangularsubim- age area centered at (x,y). The center of the subim- age is moved from pixel to pixel starting, say, at the top left corner. The operator Tnow refers to applying some transformation at each location (x/prime,y/prime)∈N(x,y)and suitably aggregating to yield the output g, at that location. The process utilizes only the pixels in the area of the image spanned by the neighborhood. 1.2. Contrast Stretching Fromtheabove,weseethatanycontinuousfunction with domain as the grey values of the input image and the range as the grey levels of the output image can be used dependent on the applications / utility. Often the images to be processed suﬀer from low contrasts. Lowcontrastimagescanresultfrompoor illumination, lack of dynamic range in the imag- ing sensor, or even wrong setting of a lens aperture during image acquisition. Hence, there is a need for contrast-stretching, i.e., highlighting a speciﬁc range of gray levels in an image. The idea behind contrast stretching is to increase the dynamic range of the gray levels in the image being processed. Ap- plicationsincludeenhancingfeaturessuchasmasses of water in satellite imagery and enhancing ﬂaws in X-ray images. This is generally achieved in one of the following two ways: (a) To display a high value for all gray levels in the range of interest and a low value for all other gray levels (b) Brighten the desired range of gray levels but preserve the back- ground and gray-level tonalities in the image. In essence, we stretch the contrast present in a given image. 1.3. Histogram Processing Histograms are the basis for numerous spatial do- main processing techniques. Histogram manipula- tion can be used eﬀectively for image enhancement. Histograms are simple to calculate and also lend themselves to economic hardware implementations, thus making them a popular tool for real-time im- age processing.

SISO Fuzzy Relational Inference Systems based on Fuzzy Implications are Universal Approximators Sayantan Mandal and Balasubramaniam Jayaram, Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh - 502 205, India Email:fma10p002, jbalag@iith.ac.in Abstract In this work, we show that single input single output (SISO) fuzzy inference systems based on Fuzzy Relational Inference (FRI) with implicative interpretation of the rule base are universal approximators under suitable choice of operations for the other components of the fuzzy system. The presented proofs make no assumption on the form or representations of the considered fuzzy implications and hence show that a much larger class of fuzzy implications other than what is typically considered in the literature can be employed meaningfully in FRIs based on implicative models. A concept of Weak Coherence is proposed, which plays an important role in enlarging the class of fuzzy implications that can be considered. Keywords: Fuzzy Relational Inference, Fuzzy Implications, Universal Approximation 1. Introduction The term approximate reasoning refers to methods and methodologies that enable reasoning with im- precise inputs to obtain meaningful outputs [15]. Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS) form one particular type of approximate reasoning scheme involving fuzzy sets and are one of the best known applications of fuzzy logic in the wider sense. FIS have many degrees of freedom, namely, the underlying fuzzy partition of the input and output spaces, the fuzzy logic operations employed, the fuzzi cation and defuzzi cation proce- dures used, etc. This freedom gives rise to a variety of FIS with di ering capabilities. The best known types of FIS are the Fuzzy Relational Inference (FRI) systems [28, 45], Similarity Based Reasoning (SBR) systems [24, 34, 13, 20] and the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems [31, 32]. In this work, we focus only on the FRI systems. 1.1. Motivation for this work One of the important factors considered while employing an FIS is its approximation capability. While many studies have appeared on this topic, most of them deal with FRIs where the rules are interpreted in a non-conditional way or as just aggregation of possibile con gurations of the data (see Section 3 for details). When an implicative or a conditional interpretation of the rules is considered, there are only a few works that deal with their approximation properties. While one of the earliest studies on this topic was that of Castro [10], [11], it was later on shown by Liet al. [23], [22] that some of the operations considered by Castro led to vacuous outputs. Li et al. further went on to present their own results on it. However, the scope of their work is restricted to the following three families of fuzzy implications, namely, R-implications from left-continuous t-norms, ( S;N)- Preprint submitted to Fuzzy Sets and Systems",the nal version of this work can be found at doi:10 1016 j fss 2014 10 003,the nal version of this work can be found at doi:10 1016 j fss 2014 10 003

ABC hasbeen outperformed over some Nature Inspired Algorithms (NIAs) when tested over benchmark as well as real world optimization problems. The solution search equation ofABC is signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by a random quantity which helps in exploration at the cost of exploitation of the search space. In the solution search equation of ABC, thereis a enough chance to skip the true solution due to large step size. In order to balance between diversity and con- vergence capability of the ABC, a new local search phaseis integrated with the basic ABC to exploit the search space identiﬁed by the best individual in the swarm. In the pro- posed phase, ABC works as a local search algorithm inwhich, the step size that is required to update the best solution, is controlled by Golden Section Search approach. The proposed strategy is named as Memetic ABC(MeABC). In MeABC, new solutions are generated around the best solution and it helps to enhance the exploitation capability of ABC. MeABC is established as a modiﬁedABC algorithm through experiments over 20 test problems of different complexities and 4 well known engineering optimization problems.

It is relatively a simple and recent population based probabilistic approach for global optimization. Similar to other population based algorithms, ABC is also computa-tionally expensive due to its slow nature of search process. The solution search equation of ABC is signiﬁcantly inﬂu- enced by a random quantity which helps in exploration atthe cost of exploitation of the search space. In the solution search equation of ABC due to the large step size the chance of skipping the true solution is high. Therefore, in this paper,to balance the diversity and convergence capability of theABC, Lévy Flight random walk based local search strategy is proposed and incorporated with ABC along with opposition based learning strategy. The proposed algorithm is named asOpposition Based Lévy Flight ABC. The experiments over 14 un-biased test problems of different complexities and ﬁve well known engineering optimization problems show that theproposed algorithm outperforms the basic ABC and its recent variants namely Gbest guided ABC, Best-So-Far ABC, and Modiﬁed ABC in most of the experiments.

It isbased on the collective behavior of social creatures. Swarm based optimization algorithms ﬁnd solution by collaborative trial and error. Social creatures utilize their ability of sociallearning to solve complex tasks. Peer to peer learning behav- ior of social colonies is the main driving force behind the development of many efﬁcient swarm based optimizationalgorithms. Researchers have analyzed such behaviors anddesigned algorithms that can be used to solve nonlinear, non- convex or discrete optimization problems. Previous research [8,16,22,32] have shown that algorithms based on swarm intelligence have great potential to ﬁnd solutions of real world optimization problems. The algorithms that have emerged in recent years include ant colony optimization (ACO) [ 8], particle swarm optimization (PSO) [ 16], bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) [ 20]e t c . Artiﬁcial bee colony (ABC) optimization algorithm intro- duced by Karaboga [ 13] is a recent addition in this category. This algorithm is inspired by the behavior of honey bees when seeking a quality food source. Like any other popula- tion based optimization algorithm, ABC consists of a popu-lation of potential solutions. The potential solutions are food sources of honey bees. The ﬁtness is determined in terms of the quality (nectar amount) of the food source. ABC is rela-tively a simple, fast and population based stochastic search technique in the ﬁeld of nature inspired algorithms. There are two fundamental processes which drive the swarm to update in ABC: the variation process, whichenables exploring different areas of the search space, and the selection process, which ensures the exploitation of the pre- vious experience.

However, a number of challenges are faced by the farmers including diﬀerent diseases of plants. The detection and prevention of plant diseases are the serious concern and should be treated well on time for incre asing the productivity. There- fore, an automated plant disease detection system can be more be neﬁcial for monitoring the plants. Generally, the most diseases may be detected and classiﬁed from th e symptoms appeared on the leaves. For the same, extraction of relevant features plays an imp ortant role. A number of meth- ods exists to generate high dimensional features to be used in plant disease classiﬁcation problem such as SPAM, CHEN, LIU, and many more. However, generated fe atures also include unrelated and inessential features that lead to degradation in performance and computational eﬃciency of a classiﬁcation problem. Therefore, the choice of notable features from the high dimensional feature set is required to increase the computational eﬃciency and accura cy of a classiﬁer. This paper introduces a novel exponential spider monkey optimization which is e mployed to ﬁx the signiﬁcant features from high dimensional set of features generated by SPA M. Furthermore, the selected fea- tures are fed to support vector machine for classiﬁcation of plant s into diseased plants and healthy plants using some important characteristics of the leaves. The exp erimental outcomes illustrate that the selected features by Exponential SMO eﬀectively increas e the classiﬁcation reliability of the classiﬁer in comparison to the considered feature selection app roaches. ∗Corresponding author Email address: sandpoonia@gmail.com (Sandeep Kumar) Preprint submitted to Sustainable Computing: Informatics and Systems October 26, 2018",sandeep kumara basudev sharmab vivek kumar sharmab harish sharmac jagdish chand,sandeep kumara basudev sharmab vivek kumar sharmab harish sharmac jagdish chand

In thispaper, a new approach for numerical optimization is proposed by modeling the foraging behavior of spider monkeys. Spi- der monkeys have been categorized as ﬁssion–fusion socialstructure based animals. The animals which follow ﬁssion– fusion social systems, split themselves from large to smaller groups and vice-versa based on the scarcity or availability offood. The proposed swarm intelligence approach is namedas Spider Monkey Optimization (SMO) algorithm and can broadly be classiﬁed as an algorithm inspired by intelligent foraging behavior of ﬁssion–fusion social structure basedanimals.

The deﬁnition given by Bonabeau forthe swarm intelligence is “any attempt to design algorithms or distributed problem-solving devices inspired by the col- lective behaviour of social insect colonies and other animalsocieties” [ 3]. Swarm Intelligence is a meta-heuristic approach in the ﬁeld of nature inspired techniques that is used to solve opti-mization problems. It is based on the collective behavior ofsocial creatures. Social creatures utilize their ability of social learning and adaptation to solve complex tasks. Researchers have analyzed such behaviors and designed algorithms thatcan be used to solve nonlinear, non-convex or combinator- ial optimization problems in many science and engineering domains. Previous research [ 7,17,28,39] have shown that algorithms based on Swarm Intelligence have great poten- tial to ﬁnd a near optimal solution of real world optimiza- tion problem. The algorithms that have been emerged inrecent years are Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) [ 7], Par- ticle Swarm Optimization (PSO) [ 17], Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) [ 26], Artiﬁcial Bee Colony Optimiza- tion (ABC) [ 14]e t c . In order to design a new swarm intelligence based algo- rithm, it is necessary to understand whether a behavior is swarm intelligent behavior or not. Karaboga et al. men-tioned that Division of Labor andSelf-Organization are the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for obtaining intelligent swarming behaviors. 1.

The focus of these Monte Carlo simulations is to study the competing effects o f the homeotropic anchoring due to the surface inducing orientational ordering in the radial direction and the inherent uniaxial order promoted by the intermolecular interactions. By adopting entropic sampling procedure, we could investigate this transitio n with a high temperature precision, and we studied the effect of the surface anchoring strength on the phase diagram for a specifically chosen geometry. We find that there is a threshold anchoring strength of the surface below which uniaxial nematic phase results, and above which the isotropic fluid cools to a radially ordered nematic phase, besides of course expected changes in the phase transition temperature with the anchoring strength. In the vicinity of the threshold anchoring strength we observe a bi stable region between these two structures, clearly brought out by the characteristics of the corresponding microstates constituting the entropic ensemble. I. Introduction Confined liquid crystals have the potential to yield macroscopic states with interesting, and sometimes unexpected, equilibrium director structures; and transitions among them have been attracting attention both from the point of view of understanding the role of resulting free energy landscapes in stabilizing the different phases, as well as, in favourable cases, of exploring new applications based on such new director structures.

This paper shows results for the weak and strong conver- gence for cyclic and almost cyclic learning BPNN with penalty term (CBP-P and ACBP-P). The convergence is guaranteed under certain relaxed condi- tions for activation functions, learning rate and under the assumption for the stationary set of error function. Furthermore, the boundedness of the weights in the training procedure is obtained in a simple and clear way. Nu- merical simulations are implemented to support our theoretical results and demonstrate that ACBP-P has better performance than CBP-P on both con- vergence speed and generalization ability.

Lam Abstract— In this paper, an overview of antenna design for pas- sive radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) tags is presented. We discuss various requirements of such designs, outline a generic de- sign process including range measurement techniques and concen- trate on one practical application: RFID tag for box tracking in warehouses. A loaded meander antenna design for this application is described and its various practical aspects such as sensitivity to fabrication process and box content are analyzed. Modeling and simulation results are also presented which are in good agreement with measurement data. Index Terms— Antennas, passive modulated backscatter, radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID), tags, transponders. I. INTRODUCTION RADIO FREQUENCY identiﬁcation (RFID) is a rapidly developing technology which uses RF signals for auto- matic identiﬁcation of objects. Although the ﬁrst paper on mod- ulated backscatter (basic principle of passive RFID) was pub- lished in 1948 [1] it took considerable amount of time before the technology advanced to current level [2]. Now RFID ﬁnds many applications in various areas such as electronic toll collec- tion, asset identiﬁcation, retail item management, access con- trol, animal tracking, and vehicle security [3]. Several standards of RFID systems are currently in use (ISO, Class 0, Class 1, and Gen 2). Globally, each country has its own frequency allocation for RFID. For example, RFID UHF bands are: 866–869 MHz in Europe, 902–928 MHz in North and South America, and 950–956 MHz in Japan and some Asian countries. A typical passive RFID transponder often called “tag” consists of an an- tenna and an application speciﬁc integrated circuit (ASIC) chip. RFID tags can be active (with batteries) or passive (batteryless). A passive back-scattered RFID system operates in the fol- lowing way. A base station (reader) transmits a modulated signal with periods of unmodulated carrier, which is received by the tag antenna. The RF voltage developed on antenna terminals during unmodulated period is converted to dc. This voltage powers up the chip, which sends back the information by varying its front end complex RF input impedance. The impedance typically tog- gles between two different states, between conjugate match and some other impedance, effectively modulating the back-scat- tered signal. Fig. 1 illustrates a passive RFID system operation. Manuscript received December 18, 2004; revised June 8, 2005.

Digital Object Identiﬁer 10.1109/TAP.2005.859919Proper impedance match between the antenna and the chip is of paramount importance in RFID. Since new IC design and manufacturing is a big and costly venture, RFID tag antennas are designed for a speciﬁc ASIC available in the market. Adding an external matching network with lumped elements is usually prohibitive in RFID tags due to cost and fabrication issues. To overcome this situation, antenna can be directly matched to the ASIC which has complex impedance varying with the frequency and the input power applied to the chip. Several papers have been published on RFID antennas for both passive and active tags, including covered slot antenna design [4], circular patch antenna analysis [5], meander antenna optimization [6], planar inverted F-antenna [7], folded dipole antenna [8], etc. However, very few papers [9] provided an overview of criteria for RFID tag antenna design and an anal- ysis of practical application aspects. At the same time, there exist many papers on practical analysis and design of particular classes of antennas used for other applications [10]–[12]. In the current article, we attempted to ﬁll the existing gap. We reviewed design requirements for passive UHF RFID tag antennas, outlined the design process, described range measure- ment techniques, and proposed a performance chart for tag anal- ysis. We also presented a speciﬁc application example: a passive UHF tag design for a RFID tag placed on a cardboard box that is being tracked in standard supply chain. The design is a versa- tile loaded meander antenna which can be easily tuned for boxes with various content like dry goods or plastics. This example is supplemented with modeling and simulation results which are in close agreement with measured data. II. A NTENNA DESIGN A. Performance Criteria The most important tag performance characteristic is read range—the maximum distance at which RFID reader can de- tect the backscattered signal from the tag. Because reader sensi- tivity is typically high in comparison with tag, the read range is deﬁned by the tag response threshold. Read range is also sensi- tive to the tag orientation, the material the tag is placed on, and to the propagation environment. The read range can be calculated using Friis free-space for- mula as (1) where is the wavelength, is the power transmitted by the reader, is the gain of the transmitting antenna, is the gain of the receiving tag antenna, is the minimum threshold 0018-926X/$20.00 © 2005 IEEE",3870 ieee transactions on antennas and propagation vol 53 no 12 december 2005,3870 ieee transactions on antennas and propagation vol 53 no 12 december 2005

There are many sectors like livestock, crop production,aqua culture etc. Now, our analysis is mainly focuses on aqua culture. The aqua culture depe nds on environmental parameters like temperature, pollutants in water. Water contains chemicals from industries that chemicals damage the health of aquatic animals and also those who eat them. Farmers then started aqua farming to reduce the effect of thesechemicalsinwater,theytooksomelandanddigapond and started cultivating the fishes. But this became a burden for them to go and check the water pollutants and the conditionoffishes.Inthiscontexttheremaybealossoffish. So, by taking this as a major issue, we thought this problem can be solved with an IOT device. We considered the environmental parameters of aqua life like temperature and pollutants in water. To control and monitor theseparameters we have sensors in IOT. In this project we use different sensors embedded with micro controller. So, this will help the farmer to continuously monitor the pond orAquarium. Index Terms —Arduino, GSM, IOT, Sensors. 1. Introduction Aquaculture involves the cultivation of fishes under controlled conditions. To maintain these conditions we are using IOT technology. In IOT we are using different sensors embedded with micro controller. The aimofourprojectisto increase the production of fishes. The fishes to be cultivated without facing any problems due to the swings in climate mainly temperature and pollutants in water. As fishes livein water so that environment should be under control.

Abstract - Electronic Business (e -Business) is revolutionizing the way of communication between internal and external stakeholders in an organization. E -business can lead to competitive advantage and at the sa me time, increase profitability. There are several factors resulting on the success of e-business. One of the most important factors is trust. Acquiring customers’ trust depends on many things that an e - business controls. Some relating factors for gaining customers’ trust are: appeal of the website, product/service offering, branding, quality of service, and trusted seals. The paper seeks to address industry uncertainties and consumer concerns about commercial Internet sites by developing a framework identi fying factors and facilities for business -to consumer web sites. The framework is based on a broad literature review ranging from consumer adoption of technology -based innovations to evaluations of web sites as well as a review of internationally recognize d leading examples of Business to Consumer web sites. The evaluation framework, consisting of a sample study of 25 web sites was considered. The Survey was conducted for 750 merchants and 750 buyers. This paper presents details of the framework’s and sur vey aims to find the demand for the products, security involved, mode of advertisement, suggestions from buyers and sellers. Keywords : e-Business, trust, website, quality of service. I. INTRODUCTION The World Wide Web has emerged as a promising medium for electronic commerce and thousands of “dot. com” and “brick and mortar” organizations have set up commercial websites to do business over the Internet (Lightner, 2004; Duffy and Dale, 2002; O’Connor and O’Keefe, 1997). The commercial websites hence deploye d have the potential to support supply chain operations in general and procurement in particular (Gunasekaran and Ngai, 2004). Today, business -to-business transactions account for the largest proportion of the transactions conducted over the Internet (Chak raborty et al ., 2002). Clearly, electronic commerce over the Internet has offered important advantages including a more efficient way to conduct business transactions for buyers and vendors alike (DeLone and McLean, 2004; Chakraborty et al., 2002; Bakos, 1 997; Barua et al ., 1997). In this context, commercial websites play a central role. As the importance of commercial websites increases, so does the need to assess the factors associated with their success. Previous research on commercial websites has very often focused on quality and effectiveness issues and has examined the key properties that improve online buyers’ satisfaction, boost traffic generation or increase the likelihood of online purchase (Tarafdar and Zhang, 2006; Shchiglik and Barnes, 2004). This research goes beyond the simple investigation of the highly desirable attributes that contribute to website quality or effectiveness. Focusing on the services web systems can provide, this study analyzes the functionalities of commercial websites used for electronic procurement and links them with the benefits as perceived by users and with relevant business operations. For organizations engaged in electronic commerce, managers must make decisions about the design of commercial websites and about the ( re)design of the business operations hence supported. In this context, managers must balance their business strategy and operations between “pure play electronic commerce” and “brick and mortar commerce” (Bahn and Fischer, 2003; El Sawy, 2001). Managers mu st also justify the cost of developing and maintaining commercial websites, cost which increases considerably as advanced functionalities are added (Rao et al ., 2003; Vinocur 2002). Commercial websites have long been considered as an advertising media and traditional models of advertising persuasion have been successfully transposed to understand their effects (Karson and Fisher, 2005).",international journal of computer trends and tec hnology - may to june issue 2011,international journal of computer trends and tec hnology - may to june issue 2011

College of Engineering and Technology, Paritala, Vijayawada, India E-mail: kvsambasivarao@rediffmail.com Wired networks differ from wireless networks in that they can support computationally intensive security protocols, have high bandwidth and offer high reliability. Strong authentication schemes can be applied to wired networks. Wireless networks on the other hand suffer from packet losses and bit errors, often have low bandwidth and have resource constraints such as computation overhead and storage. In the present work, we present a two-stage authentication scheme for wireless networks that uses a computationally intensive but highly secure strong authentication in Stage 1 and a lightweight symmetric key based protocol in Stage 2. The cost of the strong authentication adopted in Stage 1 is amortized over N sessions thus reducing the overall cost of the scheme. We adapt the Dual- signature based IKE authentication that we proposed in our earlier work and employ it as Stage 1 authentication. The Symmetric key protocol in Stage 2 authentication that we propose uses the symmetric keys that are generated in Stage1. Keywords: Mutual Authentication, Wireless Networks, Symmetric Key Encryption, IKE Strong Authentication. 1.INTRODUCTION Internet Key Exchange (IKE) [1,2] is a key generation and authentication protocol for Internet Security protocol (IPSec) [3]. Adaptations have been proposed in the literature for IKE authentication [4,5]. We proposed an authentication scheme [4] for use in IKE main mode methods that relies on private keys and public key certificates to achieve mutual authentication between a pair of parties. A concept called Dual Signature is employed in that authentication scheme which involves a signed hash value of the concatenated hash values of the private key and the public key certificate of the sender. Sender authentication is completed when the remote party is able to open the Dual Signature with the sender’s public key as this is proof that the sender possesses the corresponding private key. In this manner, receiver authentication and thus mutual authentication is achieved. Establishment of Security Associations (SAs) follow with session key generation. This is a strong authentication scheme that is readily applicable to wired networks. In the current work, we extend the Dual-signature based IKE authentication and supplement it with a proposed symmetric key based authentication scheme for two party communication that renders it highly suitable for Wired-Wireless and Wireless networks [6 ].2.LITERATURE SURVEY Commonly used authentication techniques are based on hash functions [7], digital signatures [8,9], time stamps [10], biometrics [11] and identity [12]. Hash algorithms take a finite length message or string as input and generate a fixed length string which is much smaller. Keyed hash functions are often used for message authentication. Lee et al. propose a light weight user authentication scheme for mobile communication based on one-way hash functions and smart cards [13]. Hoffman discusses the vulnerabilities of MD5 and SHA-1 hash algorithms and suggests the use of stronger hash algorithms such as the SHA-2 family. He suggests that certificates should be signed by SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 hash algorithms [7]. Homomorphism is used when an algebraic function on one form of input is the equivalent of another algebraic function on the equivalent ciphertext [14]. Homo- morphism functions can be used to map identities to the equivalent cryptographic keys in our current work. Caldera et al. [15] discuss the performance and limitations of IPSec and IKE when used in wireless and mobile networks. Bezawada et al. [16] describe constructs using symmetric key encryption that amortize the cost of session key establishment over N sessions.",international journal of computer science and communicationvol 2 no 2 july-december 2011 pp 419-422,international journal of computer science and communicationvol 2 no 2 july-december 2011 pp 419-422

It evolves csets of genetic programs to create c 7 ensembles. During mutation operation, our method exploits the8 ﬁtness as well as unﬁtness of features, which dynamically change9 with generations with a view to using a set of highly relevant10 features with low redundancy. The classiﬁers of ith class deter- 11 mine the net belongingness of an unknown data point to the ith 12 class using a weighted voting scheme, which makes use of the13 FP and FN mistakes made on the training data. We test our14 method on eight microarray and 11 text data sets with diverse15 number of classes (from 2 to 44), large number of features16 (from 2000 to 49 151), and high feature-to-sample ratio (from17 1.03 to 273.1).

A model, called classiﬁer, is used to 37 solve this problem. The classiﬁer encodes a set of criteria. 38 Depending upon some features of the data point, these crite- 39 ria assign the data point to a particular class [ 1]. Sometimes, 40 ensembles of weak classiﬁers are used to obtain better classi- 41 ﬁcation accuracy. High dimensionality, high feature-to-sample 42 ratio, and redundant and/or noisy features are some common 43 sources of difﬁculties associated with classiﬁcation. 44 Feature selection (FS) is a process to select a small but use- 45 ful subset of features from the set of available features which 46 is adequate for solving the problem in an efﬁcient manner. 47 Some available features may be redundant, not useful, and may 48 cause confusion during the learning phase. These unwanted 49 features needlessly increase the size and complexity of the fea- 50 ture space. It increases the computation cost for learning, and 51 may sometimes be responsible for ﬁnding suboptimal solu- 52 tions of the problem. This makes FS techniques important for 53 the analysis of high dimensional data sets, especially when 54 feature-to-sample ratio is extremely high. 55 The microarray technology has made it possible to diagnose 56 different types of cancers directly using the microarray data 57 sets. One of the main difﬁculties we face to do this is the high 58 feature-to-sample ratio of microarray data sets, which makes 59 FS an important step. Finding keywords as well as contexts 60 from text data is essential to detect (without human interven- 61 tion) the context of web pages, emails, or questions/answers, 62 etc. A large set of distinct words in large texts (high num- 63 ber of features) and many categories of texts (high number of 64 classes) are the two complicated challenges that we face in 65 this task. 66 Genetic programming (GP) [ 2]–[5] is a biological-evolution 67 inspired methodology where each solution is a program or 68 an equation that evolves with one or more objective func- 69 tions to perform speciﬁc tasks.

Liu and Xu [ 19] 74 used GP to create ensembles of classiﬁers (genetic programs). 75 They have used these ensembles to classify microarray data 76 sets.

In this article, the researcher develops an image coding tech- nique which is based on the wolf-sheep predation model. In the de- sign, images are converted to virtual worlds of sheep, routes and wolves. Wolves in this model wander around searching for sheep while the algo- rithm tracks their movement. A wolf has seven movements which capture all the directions of the wolf. In addition, the researcher introduces one extra move of the wolf the purpose of which is to provide a shorter string of movements and to enhance the compression ratio. The rst coordi- nates and the movements of the wolf are tracked and recorded. Then, arithmetic coding is applied on the string of movements to further com- press it. The algorithm was applied on a set of images and the results were compared with other algorithms in the research community. The experimental results reveal that the size of the compressed string of wolf movements o er a higher reduction in space and the compression ratio is higher than those of many existing compression algorithms including G3, G4, JBIG1, JBIG2 and the recent agent-based model of ant colonies.

These values are normally black and white. Binary images can be used in a variety of applications such as analyzing textual documents and representing gnomic strings [24, 35]. One advantage of binary images is their small size compared to grayscale and color images. A concern that remains to impact the image processing domain is the growing of extremely large amounts of data everyday. This issue makes it crucial to explore new image compression techniques. A tremendous amount of work has been done in the eld of image compression and researchers tackled the problem from di erent perspectives. JBIG1 is an international standard designed to compress binary images such as fax documents [13]. JBIG2 is a newer standard in binary image compression.

Keywords: Ant Colonies, Pheromone, Proximity, Binary Images, Arithmetic Coding. Abstract: Ant colonies emerged as a topic of research and they are applied in different ﬁelds. In this paper, we develop an algorithm based on the concept of ant colonies and we utilize if for image coding and compression. To apply the algorithm on images, we represent each image as a virtual world which contains food and routes for ants to walk and search for it. Ants in the algorithm have certain type of movements depending on when and where they ﬁnd food. When an ant ﬁnds food, it releases a pheromone, which allows other ants to follow the source of food. This increases the likelihood that food areas are covered. The chemical evaporates after a certain amount of time, which in turn helps ants move to cover another food area. In addition to the pheromone, ants use proximity awareness to detect other ants in the surrounding, which can help ants cover more food areas. When an ant ﬁnds food, it moves to that location and the movement and coordinates are recorded. If there is no food, an ant moves randomly to a location in the neighborhood and starts searching. We ran our algorithm on a set of 8 images and the empirical results showed that we could outperform many techniques in image compression including JBIG2. 1 INTRODUCTION In reality, ants are good at identifying the nearest path to the food and readjust to variations in their surroun- dings (Beckers et al., 1992). It is well known that an ant drops a chemical while searching and ants choose to follow a route which has a high concentration of the chemical. This nature of movement and commu- nication in an ant colony explains how ants search and identify the sources of food in a short amount of time. This behavior of ants helped researchers solve many real-life problems and has been explored by scien- tists from different perspectives. Mullen et al. (2009) reviewed the literature of ant colony algorithms and their applications. A classical example is applying the structure of ant colonies to the traveling salesman problem (Maniezzo, 1992). This work was subject to further exploration and development in many ﬁelds of research (Gambardella and Dorigo, 2015; Dorigo and Gambardella, 2016; Neto and Godinho Filho, 2013). For example, chemicals released by ants when they ﬁnd a source of food were helpful in ﬁnding out the optimum routes for evacuation during a tsunami (For- cael et al., 2014). Similarly, Li et al. (2008) used anant colony algorithm to shorten the time of coding, which reduced the amount of searching. In the same vein, Jaferzadeh et al. (2009) developed a method for fractal image compression which forces ants to move to certain regions in the image, the purpose of which is to expedite the encoding process. Although there has been a tremendous amount of work which utilizes ant colonies in different appli- cations, our vast research did not ﬁnd any work in applying ant colonies in lossless image compression for binary images. The contribution of this paper is to design an ant colony algorithm derived from the behavior of real ants; to design ant movement rules which are fed into the algorithm; to utilize the power of arithmetic encoding algorithm in ant movement to provide a higher compression ratio; and to apply it on images simulated as virtual environments which con- tain ants, food and routes for ants to move and search for food. The algorithm in this research is meant to provide a new approach on how ant colonies can be used in binary image coding and compression.

In this paper, we utilize the NetLogo HIV model in con- structing an environment for bi-level image encoding and employ it in compression. Our model considers converting an image into a virtual environment that comprises female agents testing positive and negative for HIV. Female agents are scattered according to the allocation of the pixels in the original images to be tested. The simulation considers in- troducing male agents that test positive for HIV, the purpose of which is to track their movements while infecting other HIV- female agents. The progressions of the HIV+ male agents within the simulation take advantage of the relative encoding approach previously used by other image processing and agent-based modeling researchers. That is to say, the simulation allows generating a high proportion of similar movement forms that are similarly encoded regardless of the movements of agents. This is followed up by applying Hu man coding to the obtained chains of movement strings for further reduction. The ultimate results reveal that our product could outperform existing benchmarks using all the images we employed in testing. Keywords: AIDS ·NetLogo ·agent-based model ·chain code ·com- pression ·Hu man coding 1 Introduction The accelerated expansion of computerized information such as digital docu- ments, and data generated from social media, the Internet of Things (IoT), and Smart Cities (SC), has enlarged the demand for exploring new approaches to encode existing information and decrease its initial size. Among the approaches utilized to encode the data is called `chain coding' that was rst introduced by Freeman in 1961 [18]. His approach considers going along the borders of an image or contour to encode information based on 4 or 8 coding directions. Since then, the Freeman approach was subjective to further developments and enhancements, and researchers are still using it as a foundational method to ICCS Camera Ready Version 2021 To cite this paper please use the nal published version: DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-77961-0_2",an innovative employment of the netlogo aids,an innovative employment of the netlogo aids

Intell. Syst. 2015; 24(4): 449–465 Shikha Jain* and Krishna Asawa* EMIA: Emotion Model for Intelligent Agent Abstract : Emotions play a significant role in human cognitive processes such as attention, motivation, learn- ing, memory, and decision making. Many researchers have worked in the field of incorporating emotions in a cognitive agent. However, each model has its own merits and demerits. Moreover, most studies on emotion focus on steady-state emotions than emotion switching. Thus, in this article, a domain-independent com-putational model of emotions for intelligent agent is proposed that have modules for emotion elicitation, emotion regulation, and emotion transition. The model is built on some well-known psychological theories such as appraisal theories of emotions, emotion regulation theory, and multistore human memory model. The design of the model is using the concept of fuzzy logic to handle uncertain and subjective information. The main focus is on primary emotions as suggested by Ekman; however, simultaneous elicitation of multiple emotions (called secondary emotion) is also supported by the model. Keywords: Emotion, emotion modeling, emotion elicitation, emotion regulation, emotion transition. DOI 10.1515/jisys-2014-0071 Received March 15, 2014; previously published online January 10, 2015. 1 Introduction Cognitive-emotive interactions have been the subject of extensive research in the past decades. Progress in cognitive psychology and cognitive science, in particular the delineation of distinct mechanisms com-prising cognitive processing [29], such as attention, motivation, learning, memory, and decision making, has contributed to a more careful analysis of the effects of different emotions on cognition and vice versa. Recent research in neuroscience has shown that without emotions, we have difficulty in making even simple decisions, such as what clothes to wear in the morning [7]. In addition to decision-making and moral judgment tasks, Ortony, Clore, and Collins (OCC) [28] found that emotions can alter our perceptions and interpretations of the physical world. In an experiment conducted by the authors, they asked the par - ticipants to estimate the steepness of a hill after listening to either happy or sad music. Those who listened to Mahler – the prototypical “sad” music – rated the hill as significantly steeper than those who listened to Mozart (“happy” music). As emotion influences most cognitive processes, it makes an agent’s behavior more human-like, more believable, and more intelligent. As a result, there is huge demand for cognitive-emotive centric applications of a wide range, like in education/learning, entertainment, sales and marketing, health care and well-being of old adults, games, counseling, and many more. Many researchers from different fields have proposed formal models that describe the processes related to emotion modeling [2, 6, 8, 12, 14, 20, 21, 27 , 42]. Never - theless, current emotion models in software agents are much simpler than the human emotional complexity. Although sufficient work has been carried out in emotion recognition and emotion expression, many studies are ongoing in the field of emotion modeling, regulation, and transition mechanisms. In this article, we propose a domain-independent computational model of emotion modeling for intel - ligent agent (EMIA) situated in a virtual environment. It uses the concept of a fuzzy classifier to model more *Corresponding authors: Shikha Jain and Krishna Asawa, Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Department of Computer Science, Noida, India, e-mail: shi_81@rediffmail.com, krishna.asawa@jiit.ac.in",emia: emotion model for intelligent agent,emia: emotion model for intelligent agent

Today diverse applications generate a tremendous amount of data in different formats. These data and information exchanged on the Web are commonly expressed as nested representation such as XML, JSON, etc. Unlike the traditional database system, they do not possess a rigid schema. In gen-eral, the nested data is managed by storing data and its structures separately which significantly reduces the performance of data retrieving. Ensuring efficiency of processing queries which locates the exact positions of the elements has become a big challenging issue. There are different indexing structures which have been proposed in the literature to improve the perfor - mance of the query processing on the nested structure. Most of the past researches on nested structure con-centrate on the structure alone. This paper proposes new index structure which combines siblings of the terminal nodes as one path which efficiently processes twig queries with less number of lookups and joins. The proposed approach is compared with some of the existing approaches. The results also show that they are processed with better performance compared to the existing ones .

Introduction The extensible Markup Language (XML) is a popular representation structure for expressing nested data. And, it is the accepted standard to represent and transport data on the World Wide Web (WWW). As the number of XML docu-ments on the WWW is growing, there arises a need of an effective way to retrieve data quickly and easily. To retrieve the desired information from the nested structure in an efficient and ac-curate way is one crucial issue in XML query processing. Database indexing gives a boost for data querying. It helps to find the data in an XML document without traversing the en- tire document. Hence, it is necessary to develop an effective structure, which indexes the nested structure and content efficiently and supports query processing with high performance. There are various indexing schemes proposed in the literature. Most of these schemes address different issues of the query processing. In [1], the indexing scheme processes the simple path query without branches. The indexing scheme [2] supports structural queries without any value predicates. The indexing scheme with Root Path and Data Path indexes [3] evaluates XML twig queries with value predicates. The Root Path index stores the prefix, root-to-leaf paths along with the leaf value and reversed schema path. The disadvantage of this scheme is the storage size of the index. There are sev- eral other indexes [4] – [6] which have been proposed to answer path queries. But these in-dexing schemes suffer from some drawbacks such as their increased size, designed for an- swering only a certain type of queries like only path query without value predicates, and their inefficiency in processing branch query etc.",cit journal of computing and information technology vol 25 no 3 september 2017 211 225,cit journal of computing and information technology vol 25 no 3 september 2017 211 225

Signature veri/f_ication is the widely used biometric veri/f_ication method for maintaining individual privacy. It is generally used in legal documents and in /f_inancial transactions. A vast range of research has been done so far to tackle diﬀerent system issues, but there are various hot issues that remain unaddressed. /T_he scale and orientation of the signatures are some issues to address, and the deformation of the signature within the genuine examples is the most critical for the veri/f_ication system. /T_he extent of this deformation is the basis for verifying a given sample as a genuine or forgery signature, but in the case of only a single signature sample for a class, the intra-class variation is not available for decision-making, making the task diﬃcult. Besides this, most real- world signature veri/f_ication repositories have only one genuine sample, and the veri/f_ication system is abiding to verify the query signature with a single target sample. In this work, we utilize a two-phase system requiring only one target signature image to verify a query signature image. It takes care of the target signature’s scaling, orientation, and spatial translation in the /f_irst phase. It creates a transformed signature image utilizing the aﬃne transformation matrix predicted by a deep neural network. /T_he second phase uses this transformed sample image and veri/f_ies the given sample as the target signature with the help of another deep neural network. /T_he GPDS synthetic and MCYT datasets are used for the experimental analysis. /T_he performance analysis of the proposed method is carried out on FAR, FRR, and AER measures. /T_he proposed method obtained leading performance with 3.56 average error rate (AER) on GPDS synthetic, 4.15 AER on CEDAR, and 3.51 AER on MCYT-75 datasets. 1. Introduction /T_he biometric system utilizes an individual’s physiological or behavioural characteristics for identi/f_ication, veri/f_ication,and authentication. /T_he invariable physiological character-istics include DNA, iris, /f_ingerprint, palm, and facial ex-pression [1, 2], whereas behavioural traits cover voice,signature, and handwriting [1, 3, 4]. Physical characteristics such as /f_ingerprint and iris are often used because of theirhigh performance. However, handwriting signatures are still being used and researched due to their ubiquitous use andcultural acceptance for personal authentication. Over cen-turies, its presence in legal documents, property wills andtestaments, agreements, contracts, administrative records,and other legal and /f_inancial documents established it as avaluable trait.

To apply this method, images or videos need to be obtained from a camera to create a “camera ﬁngerprint” which then can be compared against the PRNU of the query media whose origin is under question. The ﬁngerprint extraction process can be time consuming when a large number of video frames or images have to be denoised. This may need to be done when the individual images have been subjected to high compression or other geometric processing such as video stabilization. This paper investigates a simple, yet effective and efﬁcient technique to create a camera ﬁngerprint when so many still images need to be denoised. The technique utilizes Spatial Domain Averaged (SDA) frames. An SDA-frame is the arithmetic mean of multiple still images. When it is used for ﬁngerprint extraction, the number of denoising operations can be signiﬁcantly decreased with little or no performance loss. Experimental results show that the proposed method can work more than 50times faster than conventional methods while providing similar matching results. Index Terms —PRNU, video forensics, camera ﬁngerprint extraction, image forensics. I. I NTRODUCTION PRNU-based source camera attribution is a well-studied and successful method in media forensics for ﬁnding the source camera of an anonymous image or video [1]. The method is based on the unique Photo Response Non Uni- formity (PRNU) noise of a camera sensor array stemming from manufacturing imperfections. This PRNU noise can act as a camera ﬁngerprint. The PRNU approach is often used in two scenarios: camera veriﬁcation and camera identiﬁcation. Camera veriﬁcation aims to establish if a given query image or a video is taken by a suspect camera. This is done by correlating the noise estimated from the query image or video with the ﬁngerprint of the camera usually is computed by taking pictures from the camera under controlled conditions. In camera identiﬁcation, the potential source camera of the query image or video is determined from a large database of camera ﬁngerprints. One can view camera identiﬁcation as essentially the same as performing ncamera veriﬁcation tasks where nis the number of camera ﬁngerprints in the database. However, when performing identiﬁcation, it is assumed that the camera ﬁngerprints are pre-computed. In both veriﬁcation and identiﬁcation, it is often the case that there is no camera available to create ﬁngerprints under con- Samet Taspinar (email: st89@nyu.edu) and Manoranjan Mohanty email: manoranjan.mohanty@nyu.edu) are with Center for Cyber Security, New York University Abu Dhabi, UAE.

Rather, camera ﬁngerprints are estimated from a set of publicly available media assumed to be from the same camera. Such media can have a very diverse range of quality and content and often lacks metadata. For efﬁcient ﬁngerprint matching in large databases, various approaches have been proposed. Fridrich et al. [2] proposed the use of ﬁngerprint digests in which a subset of ﬁngerprint elements having the highest sensitivity are used instead of the entire ﬁngerprint. Bayram et al. [3] introduced binarization where each ﬁngerprint element is represented by a single bit. Valsesia et al. [4] proposed the idea of applying random projections to reduce ﬁngerprint dimension. Bayram et. al. [5] introduced group testing via composite ﬁngerprint that focuses on decreasing the number of correlations rather than decreas- ing the size (storage) of a ﬁngerprint. Recently, Taspinar et al. [6] proposed a hybrid approach that utilizes both decreasing the size of a ﬁngerprint and the number of correlations. All these methods were designed and tested for images, however they can also be used for videos. Although the image-centric PRNU-based method can be extended to video [7]–[9], source camera attribution with video presents a number of new challenges. First, a video frame is much more compressed than a typical image. Therefore, the PRNU signal extracted from a video frame is of signiﬁcantly lower quality than one obtained from an image. As a result, a larger number of video frames are required to compute the ﬁngerprint. In fact, Chuang et. al. [7] found that it is best to use all the frames instead of using only the I- or P-frames to compute a ﬁngerprint. Using a large number of frames can introduce signiﬁcant computation overhead. For example, computing a ﬁngerprint from 60I-frames of a one-minute HD video requires one to two minutes, whereas 30to40minutes is required if all frames are used. In the case of camera identiﬁcation, the amount of compu- tation can be prohibitive in practical scenarios. For example, for computing ﬁngerprints from a thousand one-minute Full HD videos (using all 1800 frames) using a PC may take more than 20days. Clearly, with billions of media objects uploaded every day on the Internet, large scale camera source identiﬁcation becomes quickly infeasible. Although camera ﬁngerprints stored in a database may have to be computed just once by a system, computing a ﬁngerprint estimate at run-time from a query video can be prohibitive when faced with a reasonable number of query videos presented to the camera identiﬁcation system in a day. Besides source camera identiﬁcation, digital stabilization operations performed within modern cameras also present a signiﬁcant challenge for PRNU-based source camera veriﬁ-arXiv:1909.04573v1 [cs.MM] 10 Sep 2019",ieee transactions on information forensics and security 1,ieee transactions on information forensics and security 1

ABSTRACT Explainable Artiﬁcial Intelligence (XAI) is an emerging area of research in the ﬁeld of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI). XAI can explain how AI obtained a particular solution (e.g., classiﬁcation or object detection) and can also answer other ""wh"" questions. This explainability is not possible in traditional AI. Explainablity is essential for critical applications, such as defence, health care, law and order, and autonomous driving vehicles, etc, where the know how is required for trust and transparency. A number of XAI techniques so far have been purposed for such applications. This paper provides an overview of these techniques from a multimedia (i.e., text, image, audio, and video) point of view. Advantages and shortcomings of these techniques have been discussed, and pointers to some future directions have also been provided. INDEX TERMS Explainable Artiﬁcial Intelligence (XAI), Explainability, Interpretable Artiﬁcial Intelli- gence. I. INTRODUCTION In recent years, Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI)-based applica- tions have been used in various aspects of human life, such as science, business, ﬁnance and social networking, etc. AI- based algorithms have been successfully applied to all types of data (text, image, audio, video) in various applications, such as healthcare, defence, law and order, governance, au- tonomous industry, etc. An AI algorithm can now efﬁciently solve a classiﬁcation, regression, clustering, transfer learning or optimizations problem [16]. This current day AI is mainly limited to a sub-branch known as machine learning (ML). Machine learning provides a computer with a set of examples (aka training data set), and let the computer learn from the example set. Once well trained, the computer can then answer questions related to what it was taught previously. Typically, this traditional AI is a blackbox that can answer “yes” and “no” type questions without elaborating how that answer is obtained. In many applications, an explanation of how an answer was obtained is crucial for ensuring trust and transparency. An example of one such application is a medical application, where the doctors should be damn sure about a conclusion. They, for example, would like to know how AI decided whether someone is suffering from a disease by analyzing a CT scan image. AI-based systems are not 100% perfect. An FIGURE 1: AI vs XAI insight of how a result was obtained will therefore not only can induce trustfulness but also can avoid life-threatening errors. In some other applications (e.g., law and order), answers to other ""wh"" questions (such as ""why"", ""when"", ""where"", etc.) could be required. The traditional AI is unable to answer these ""wh"" questions. This explainability requirement lead a new area of AI research, know as Explainable AI (XAI).

In this paper, we propose a framework for cloud-based remote medical data visualization that protects the security of data at the cloud centers. To achieve this,we integrate the cryptographic secret sharing with pre-classiﬁcation volume ray-casting and propose a secure volume ray-casting pipeline that hides the color-coded information of the secret medical dataduring rendering at the data centers. Results and analysis show the utility of the proposed framework.

INTRODUCTION Remote data visualization allows distant medical experts to an- alyze images that are captured by host hospitals. It typically uses aclient-server architecture, where the host hospital that captures the data acts as the server and the remote display device acts as the client. In this architecture, the 3D medical data rendering is usually performed on the server since it produces better quality images. Recently, it has been proposed that cloud data centers can be used for rendering [1, 2]. Although cloud-based rendering has many advantages over conventional server-side rendering, security is a major issue when medical data rendering is carried out by thethird party cloud providers. An adversary with access to medical data of patients can misuse it in a number of ways. Firstly, for economical beneﬁts, the adversary may illegally sell the disease in-formation of patients to other interested parties such as insurance companies. Secondly, for publicity, both health information and the name of the admitting hospital of a prominent person may beleaked to public and media. Thirdly, a medical image can be pur- posefully modiﬁed to provide misleading information to user [3]. ∗This work was completed when Manoranjan Mohanty was an in- tern at the University of Winnipeg.

Copyright 2012 ACM 978-1-4503-1089-5/12/10 ...$15.00.Therefore, medical data visualization techniques involving cloud data centers must prioritize the need for protecting patient data. In this paper, we address the challenge of keeping color-coded information of medical image secret from the cloud data centers.Color codes are often used to represent the complex structure and function of an entity in the medical image [4]. In addition, abnor- mality is also color coded in the image. For example, color is usedto code the area of shrinkage in MRI images of dementia and theloss of cortical thickness in images of Huntington’s diseases [4]. Therefore, withholding of color-coded data from the cloud data centers protects the medical image from any adversary. The opacityvalue, however, can be disclosed to the cloud data center to accel- erate rendering. Although the opacity value of the medical image reveals the shape of an entity, in the absence of color-coded valuesit does not divulge any conﬁdential information. This paper proposes a framework for cloud-based rendering that protects color-coded information of the medical data from an ad-versary with access to cloud data centers. The core idea behind this framework is to integrate a variation of secret sharing method that does not use modular prime operation with the cloud-based render-ing. The modiﬁed scheme, however, uses the typical property of secret sharing that a secret data can be divided into nshares in a way that the shares themselves are arbitrary and the secret can be reconstructed if and only if at least k≤nshares are used. The avoidance of modular prime operation keeps in tact the informa- tion theoretic security property of the original scheme but with loss of some information that is resulted from the one-to-one relationbetween the secret value and any of its share value. In the proposed framework, we create nnumber of shares of the 3D medical data at the server where the data is captured. These3D data shares are then distributed among ncloud data centers. Upon receiving rendering request from the client, each of the n data centers performs volume ray-casting on their 3D data sharesand produces corresponding share image which is again arbitrary. The share images from any kcloud data centers are received at the client end and the secret image is reconstructed. In this way, cloud data centers can possess only the share data which does not revealany information about the secret. Hence, patient’s data is secured in a group of at most k−1number of data centers. Secret sharing method is chosen over other security schemes such as AES since it provides distributed control over the secrecyof the data rather than single point vulnerability and for its homo- morphic property that make it compliant with volume ray-casting. 2.

Recently, the video conferencing tool Zoom has become extremely popular for its simple-to-use feature and low network bandwith requirement. However, Zoom has seri- ous security and privacy issues. Due to weak authentication mecha- nisms, unauthorized persons are invading Zoom sessions and creat- ing disturbances (known as Zoom bombing). In this paper, we pro- pose a preliminary work towards a seamless authentication mecha- nism for Zoom-based teaching and meeting. Our method is based on PRNU (Photo Response Non Uniformity)-based camera authentica- tion, which can authenticate the camera of a device used in a Zoom meeting without requiring any assistance from the participants (e.g., needing the participant to provide biometric). Results from a small- scale experiment validates the proposed method. Index Terms —Oneline meeting and teaching, Video confer- encing, PRNU-based source camera attribution. 1. INTRODUCTION The current coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic situation has brought a lot of changes in how teaching and meeting are happening around the world. Due to lockdowns and travel restrictions, regular face-to-face teaching (classroom teaching) and face-to-face meeting are being re- placed with video conference-based online teaching and meeting. Recently, the video conferencing tool Zoom1has become extremely popular for its simple-to-use feature and low network bandwidth re- quirement, resulting so-called Zoom booming [1]. However, as has been reported by many media houses and ac- knowledged by Zoom, Zoom has serious security and privacy is- sues [2]. For lowering the network bandwidth and network latency requirements, Zoom does not use end-to-end encryption (as encryp- tion introduces extra overheads). Although a password-based au- thentication mechanism has been provided, the use of password is also optional for making Zoom more user-friendly. The password setting is also not provided in the default Zoom setup. As a result, many Zoom sessions are password-less. Some Zoom sessions are at- tended by an unauthorized persons, leading to Zoom bombing (teach- ers being racially abused and students being shown pornographic videos), and Zoom eavesdropping (conﬁdential conversation being secretly heard) issues [3, 4]. A combination of Zoom features can be used for addressing the security and privacy issues in some extent [5]. Besides using the password, the wait room feature can be used by the teacher or the 1https://zoom.us/meeting host for accepting or rejecting joining requests from stu- dents or meeting participants [6]. Although this feature can be useful in controlling a small classroom or meeting, for a bigger classroom or meeting (where hundreds of participant can join), this feature can also fail. It could be near impossible for the teacher or the meet- ing host for remembering hundreds of names and online identities of students and meeting participants. This solution also can create a lot of hassle as some of the joining requests can be attended in-the- middle of the Zoom session. Besides the wait room feature, other guidelines, such as not to share the meeting links in public domain, sharing the meeting links just before the start of the meeting and not using recurring meeting options, and controlling the screen share op- tion etc. can be used. None of them, however, can provide full-proof defense against a savvy attacker (e.g., a hacker). By taking Zoom as an example, in this paper, we present a pre- liminary work towards a scalable, automatic, and hassle-free authen- tication scheme for video-conferencing-based online meeting and teaching. The proposed scheme combines PRNU [7] (Photo Re- sponse Non-Uniformity)-based authentication with password-based authentication. The PRNU-based authentication can seamlessly au- thenticate a meeting participant (or a student) by authenticating the camera of the device she uses in the meeting (or online classroom). In such cases, the meeting participant enjoys the same usability that she enjoys with default zoom setup (no password to remember, no keys to press, no bio-metric required). Whenever the PRNU-based scheme cannot authenticate, the participant is asked to enter the pass- word. The proposed scheme was experimentally validated by vali- dating the effectiveness of the PRNU-based method for the webcams of desktops, and selﬁe-camera of mobile phones and tablets (as these cameras are typically used in Zoom sessions). The experiment with a set of 10cameras shows promising result. The rest of the paper has been organized as follows. Section 2 presents related work and provides an overview of how Zoom works. In Section 3, we discuss the proposed method. Section 4 presents experimental result. Finally, Section 5 concludes and also discusses how we intend to extend this paper. In the rest of the paper, we will use the term Zoom meeting in the place of Zoom-based meeting or Zoom-based teaching. 2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1. Video Conferencing Using Zoom Zoom is arguably one of the most popular video conferencing tool now. One of the main reasons for this popularity is Zoom’s easy- to-use feature. For joining an online meeting room, the participant does not need to go with the hassle of registering into Zoom. Only a meeting ID (which is a multi-digit number) is enough.

INTRODUCTION In the early stages of an epidemic, the growth rate of the infection spread follows an ex ponential path. Ex trapolation of available data is the most crucial method used to depict the growth dynamics of the epidemic. The predicted data help the policymakers to take preventive measures in the right direction to curb the spread of disease in the community.[11] In case of an epidemic, epidemic growth models are constructed to ex trapolate the rate at which the disease might spread in the community. These epidemic growth models are constructed using the parameters obtained by ex ploring available data, using bootstrap resampling methods. In the bootstrap resampling method, multiple simulations run on the available dataset. In consecutive simulations, parameters are adjusted to ex trapolate the most precise estimates that are further used to plot the respective epidemic growth models.[12] COV ID-19 disease is now proclaimed as a pandemic around the globe. India comes among one of the few countries in the world which have implemented complete lockdown as a preventive measure to decrease the growth in positive cases of COV ID-19 disease at an early stage of an outbreak. It has now spread across the whole world, badly affecting nations like the USA, Italy and Spain. This paper focuses on ex trapolation of available data for India to constru ct early-stage epidemic growth models to dissect the crucial driving factors that are resulting in the rapid spread of disease, to r efine the measures taken by authorities to control the pandemic and improve disease forecast.[4,5]. Logistic growth model construction is favourable and can unravel the growth and fall in the number of cases around the inflection point. If the logistic curve converges at an early s tage, it means the pandemic is under control, suggesting that the steps taken to control the pandemic are working. Whereas, if the logistic curve does not converge and shows an ex ponential growth even after the occurrence of the inflection point, then it indicates that the measures taken in order to manage the pandemic are not working, and the epidemic is still in its ea rly growth stage. Logistic models also involve calculation of important feature parameters like rate of growth at early sta ge(r), final epidemic size (K) and the number of aggregate cases at time t (C), growth deceleration (p), disease turning point(t ) Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Communication and Electronics Systems (ICCES 2020) IEEE Conference Record # 48766; IEEE Xplore ISBN: 978-1-7281-5371-1 © IEEE 2020.

These sensor nodes sense the changes in physical parameters from the sensing range and forward the information to the sink nodes or the base station. Since sensor nodes are driven with limited power batteries, prolonging the network lifetime is dif cult and very expensive, especially for hostile locations. Therefore, routing protocols for WSN must strategically distribute the dissipation of energy, so as to increase the overall lifetime of the system. Current research trends from areas, such as from Internet of Things and fog computing use sensors as the source of data. Therefore, energy-ef cient data routing in WSN is still a challenging task for real- time applications. Hierarchical grid-based routing is an energy-ef cient method for routing of data packets. This method divides the sensing area into grids and is advantageous in wireless sensor networks to enhance network lifetime. The network is partitioned into virtual equal-sized grids. The proposed mode-switched grid-based routing protocol for WSN selects one node per grid as the grid head. The routing path to the sink is established using grid heads. Grid heads are switched between active and sleep modes alternately. Therefore, not all grid heads take part in the routing process at the same time. This saves energy in grid heads and improves the network lifetime. The proposed method builds a routing path using each active grid head which leads to the sink. For handling the mobile sink movement, the routing path changes only for some grid head nodes which are nearer to the grid, in which the mobile sink is currently positioned. Data packets generated at any source node are routed directly through the data disseminating grid head nodes on the routing path to the sink. INDEX TERMS Wireless sensor networks, grid-based routing, grid head, mobile sink, energy ef ciency. I. INTRODUCTION A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a distributed net- work with small embedded devices having sensing capability called sensor nodes, which are used in huge numbers to observe physical or environmental conditions such as temper- ature, pressure, heat, humidity etc. from the environment [1]. The sensor nodes collect the variations in physical parameters and coordinate among themselves to relay the data through the sensor nodes to a base station or sink. A sensor node consists of sensing unit, a sensor to measure the physical stimuli, analog to digital converter, processing unit with a processor and storage area, a transceiver which can transmit and receive the data, and to run all devices a small battery is used. The sensor nodes are low power and low cost devices which make it appropriate to deploy them in a network in large scale. Deployment of sensor nodes in large numbersincreases the coverage of the network and enhances the reliability of data transmission and retrieval. Utilization of sensor networks may be for environmental monitoring, smart homes and of ces, surveillance, military applications and many more. Sensor nodes have some constraints like inadequate bat- tery and processing capability, low bandwidth collision-prone channels etc. Sensor nodes are often deployed in the hos- tile and unattended environment. These conditions do not allow replacement of the battery of the sensor nodes. It is necessary to improve the life of the sensor nodes. Thus, the protocols designed for this network must be energy ef cient and distributed. There must be proper balance of the load between the sensor nodes, which point to the better lifetime the sensor network. There exist many hierarchical-based rout- ing protocols, typical like cluster-based, and atypical like 198642169-3536 2017 IEEE.

Related literature on virtual ization in WSNs explored resource optimizat ion without considering communication failure in WSNs environments . The failure of a communication link in WSNs impact s many virtual networks running IoT services. In this context, this paper proposes a framework for optimizing fault tolerance in virtual ization in WSNs , focusing on heterogeneous networks for service -oriented IoT application s. An optimization problem is formulated considering fault tolerance and communication delay as two conflicting objectives . An adapted non-dominated sorting based genetic algorithm ( A-NSGA) is developed to solve the optimization problem . The major components of A-NSGA include chromosome representation, fault toleran ce and delay computation, crossover and mutation, and non -dominance based sorting. Analytical and simulation based comparative performance evaluation has been carried out. From the analysis of results, it is evident that the framework effectively optimizes fault tolerance for virtualization in WSNs . Index Terms –IoT, Virtualization, W ireless sensor networks . I.INTRODUCTION etwork virtualization has got significant attention as an enabling technology for service -oriented heterogeneous network for Internet of Things (IoT) [1]. The rigid communication architecture of Internet is one of challenging issues in IoT . Network virtualization enables Internet to retain its communication architecture while enlarging and transforming as IoT . In IoT enabled smart cities, service - oriented communication architecture is required for smart applications (see Fig.1) . It can be add ressed by implementing network as a service through virtualization [2]. Sensing as a service can be implemented in collaboration with network as a service , to support heterogeneous network ing and sensing resource optimization for smart applications in IoT.

Heterogeneous networks in Internet of Things (IoT) Network virtualization is implemented using virtual network embedding (VNE) algorithms [3]. Due to the inception and evolution of VNE, the role of Internet service provider has been divided into two parts namely, infrastructure provider and service provider. Infrastructure provider is responsible for deployment and maintenance of physical infrastructure whereas, service provider is responsible for range o f customizable services to end user. Various virtual network embedding techniques have been suggested focusing on wired -networks [ 4]. The two key issues in virtual network embedding include resource optimization [ 5], and survivability [ 6]. Due to the rece nt developments in IoT technology, network virtualization in WSNs has been envisioned [7]. Some of the initial works on the virtualization focus es on service -oriented network architecture to optimize sensing resources. An four - layered architecture for virt ualization in WSNs has been suggested , based on reducing redundant deployment of sensor networks for different IoT applications [ 8]. Another five - layered virtualization architecture has been explored to support network diversity and increase resource utili zation in IoT [ 2]. Brain -inspired adaptive architecture has been presented for embedding and running IoT applications on virtual wireless sensor networks [ 9]. The aforementioned architectures did not consider communication failure on virtual networks, caus ed by the communication failure on physical WSNs . The f ault toleran ce (reactive capability of handling communication failure in physical networks) is a pressing issue in virtualization in wired networks [ 10].

Due to the large sizes of data, clustering algorithm often take too much time. Sampling this data before clustering is commonly used to reduce this time. In this work, we propose a probabilistic sampling technique called cube sampling along with K-Prototype clustering. Cube sampling is used because of its accurate sample selection. K- Prototype is most frequently used clustering algorithm when the data is numerical as well as categorical (very common in today’s time). The novelty of this work is in obtaining the crucial inclusion probabilities for cube sampling using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Experiments on multiple datasets from the UCI repository demonstrate that cube sampled K-Prototype algorithm gives the best clustering accuracy among similarly sampled other popular clustering algorithms ( K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering (HC), Spectral Clustering (SC)). When compared with unsampled K- Prototype, K-Means, HC and SC, it still has the best accuracy with the added advantage of reduced computational complexity (due to reduced data size). Index Terms —Sampling, Cube Sampling, Clustering, K- Prototype Clustering, Principal Component Analysis, Clustering Accuracy. I. I NTRODUCTION Due to the pervasiveness of social media and the sub- sequent transformation of the world digitally, an extensive amount of data is being generated. According to a survey [1], more than 2.5 quintillion bytes of data is produced every day, which is increasing exponentially. Since not all of this data is useful, it is important to obtain some meaning from it to help in decision making. Clustering is the technique to group together the data items having similar behavior. It is often used to get the initial perception of data and is widely used. Some of the pop- ular clustering algorithms include K-Means,K-Modes,K- Prototype, Hierarchical Clustering (HC), Spectral Clustering (SC), Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) etc. [2]–[5]. K- Prototype is a commonly used clustering algorithm becauseof its ability to handle numerical and categorical data together [6]. To achieve this, it uses a combination of the K-Means and theK-Modes algorithms and is easy to implement as well. Clustering becomes difﬁcult when the size of the data is very large. One of the ways to develop an efﬁcient clustering algorithm is to sample this data. There are several sampling techniques that are commonly used. This include random sam- pling, stratiﬁed sampling, Vector Quantization (VQ), pivotal sampling, cube sampling etc. [7]–[10]. We focus on cube sampling because ﬁrstly it belongs to the class of probabilistic sampling that are accurate. Secondly , it is independent of the order of the data selected to compute the crucial inclusion probabilities [10]. To sum up, we propose cube sampled K- Prototype clustering algorithm with speciﬁc focus on data that contains numerical and categorical features. There have been a few attempts to perform clustering while using a sampling technique to reduce the data [8], [9]. In [8], authors have proposed use of VQ sampling technique along with SC. VQ is a very basic sampling technique with comparatively low accuracy. Moreover, the algorithm in [8] is speciﬁcally designed for genome data. Another work is [9], where a different probabilistic sampling technique called pivotal sampling is used with SC. Although, pivotal sampling is good in terms of accuracy, this algorithm is tested on only plant phenotypic data. This paper also uses pivotal sampling with HC. However, it also has same limitations as pivotal sampling with SC. In another work [11], the authors have used random sampling with the ensemble clustering algorithm. However, they do not show the efﬁcacy of their approach on large datasets. As evident from above discussion, cube sampling has many advantages and it has not been coupled with any of the commonly used clustering algorithms, which is the focus of this work. As mentioned above, besides combining cube sampling with K-Prototype, we integrate it with K-Means,arXiv:2108.10262v1 [cs.LG] 23 Aug 2021",cube sampled k-prototype clustering for featured,cube sampled k-prototype clustering for featured

Principally our aim is to minimize the j olt caused by organic Waste produced in agricultural fields as residue which is commonly burned causing pollution. We seek to reuse this valuable resource and turning into good quality compost for agricultural use. In this study, we des igned and constructed a Shredding machine. The machine will initially conve rt larger particle size of Collected organic waste into desired size such that it can be treated other chemical and biological processes in order to conve rt it into compost in least amount of time possible. Indifferent from the convent ional processes used this methodology elucidates the paramount problem of dumpin g, environmental pollution. In Addition to that it helps in farming b y inducing the compost. As this methodology involves mechanical, chemical and biologi cal processes for converting agricultural waste into compost making i t highly efficient and eco- friendly which is need of the hour? INTRODUCTION In the present era of 21st century the major proble m in developing countries like India are the substantial problems arising due to or ganic waste which are being produced in such a substantial amount these days. B eing agriculture dependent country India produces a large amount of organicres idues which then leads to the several problems of its disposal. These organic resi dues prevail upon the problems such as incineration, landfills, soil eros ion, bad odour, air pollution and increase in carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere. Thus we need to ensure an efficient alternative to these problems. We plan to convert this organic waste into useful resource such as compost which adds on a con siderable value to our farming . OBJECTIVES A. The existing system of conventional shredder machine is based on manual operating so it consumes more time for operation. Our main objective is to reduce time for operation. B. To modify a machine this will produce less noise, vibrations and to reduce time consumption for shredding operation by modifying tool design. C. To convert organic waste into valuable compost. LITERATURE REVIEW In 2010 Chevron M investigated the environmental impacts of centrifugal Spreader using organic compost and c ame to a conclusion that an Eco-innovative design should be Proposed to allow the designers to identify & solve the environmental related problems. In 2004 Per-Anders Hansson investigated the operations to remove the reed biomass from the lake & to use it as nutrient supply in organic crop production & came t o a conclusion that if the positive effects of nutrient removal from the lake are considered by all the three opera tions i.e. chopping, composting & harvested biomass usage, the n the total economics are highly improved. In 2007 Dr.Salah M investigated the hidden economic value of agricultural waste, to study the converting of o rganic waste into fertilizers for farming by composting agri cultural & rural waste, to combine all the major sources of po llution/ wastes in one complex called Eco-rural park or environmentally balanced rural waste complex to pro duce fertilizer, energy, animal fodder & other products & came to a conclusion that it is necessary to make a sustain able nature of agricultural & rural waste to reduce environment al pollution & to avoid the depletion of the natural r esources.

ABSTRACT Background: Depletion in estrogen level(s) especially in postmenopausal women is reported to have delayed wound healing effects; hence we have evaluated the wound healing potential of raloxifene in rat model. Objectives: Investigating the wound healing effects of raloxifene nanoemulsion for the management of postmenopausal cutaneous wounds. Materials and Methods: The optimized nanoemulsion gel contains 0.072% raloxifene hydrochloride. Female Wistar rats were used to investigate its wound healing effects. After three months of ovariectomy, wound healing effect was observed in terms of breaking strength, tensile strength, area of wound contraction, wound closure time, hydroxyproline content and histopathological changes. Results: The nanoemulsion gel exhibited better retention (34.31%) than its nanoemulsion. The raloxifene nanoemulsion gel has no erythema and no eschar formation recorded, and it is safe for topical use. In the incision wound model in ovariectomized rats, breaking (898±25g) and tensile strengths (4.47±0.12 g/mm 2) in raloxifene treated groups were found to be higher than the untreated control group. Additionally, in ovariectomized rats, wound contraction was found to be 100% in the treated group s following 20 days of post-wounding, where as in control group only 88% was contraction was observed. Also, more hydroxyproline content in raloxifene treated ovariectomized rat was observed that recommend more collagen content than the untreated ovariectomized rat but approximately similar effects to untreated non-ovariectomized rats. Histopathological studies confirmed that the raloxifene treated groups had more re-epithelialization, neo-vascularization, fibroblast proliferation, and collagen deposition than the control group. Conclusion: These results confirms that the raloxifene nanoemulsion gel has significant wound healing potential, as observed in ovariectomized rats, which will be helpful in postmenopausal cutaneous wound healing.

Recently a new algorithm for model reduction of second order linear dynamical systems with proportional damping, the Ad aptive Iterative Rational Global Arnoldi (AIRGA) algorithm [8], has been pro posed. The main computational cost of the AIRGA algorithm is in solving a seq uence of linear systems. These linear systems do change only slightly from o ne iteration step to the next. Here we focus on eﬃciently solving these systems by iterative methods and the choice of an appropriate preconditioner. We propose the use of relevant iterative algorithm and the Sparse Approximate Inverse (SPAI) preconditioner. A technique to cheaply update the SPAI prec onditioner in each iteration step of the model order reduction process is g iven. Moreover, it is shown that under certain conditions the AIRGA algorith m is stable with respect to the error introduced by iterative methods. Our th eory is illustrated by experiments. It is demonstrated that SPAI preconditione d Conjugate Gra- dient (CG) works well for model reduction of a one dimensiona l beam model with AIRGA algorithm. Moreover, the computation time of pre conditioner with update is on an average2 3-rd of the computation time of preconditioner without update. With average timings running into hours for very large sys- tems, such savings are substantial. 1.Introduction A continuous time-invariant second order linear dynamical system is of the form M¨x(t) =−D˙x(t)−Kx(t)+Fu(t), y(t) =Cpx(t)+Cv˙x(t),(1.1) whereM, D, K ∈Rn×nare mass, damping and stiﬀness matrices, respectively, F∈Rn×m,Cp,Cv∈Rq×nare constant matrices.

Recently a new algorithm for model reduction of second order linear dynamical sys- tems with proportional damping, the Adaptive Iterative Rat ional Global Arnoldi (AIRGA) algorithm [8], has been proposed. The main computational cost of the AIRG A algorithm is solving a sequence of linear systems. Usually, direct methods (e.g., LU) are us ed for solving these systems. As model sizes grow, direct methods become prohibitively expensive . Iterative methods (e.g., Krylov) scale well with size, and hence, are a good choice with an appropria te preconditioner. Preconditioned iterative methods introduce errors in line ar solves because they are not exact. They solvelinearsystems upto a certain tolerance. We prove that, under mildconditions, the AIRGA algorithm is backward stable with respect to the errors intr oduced by these inexact linear solves. Our ﬁrstassumption isuseofaRitz-Galerkinbased solverthats atisﬁesfewextra orthogonality conditions. Since Conjugate Gradient (CG) is the most popular method bas ed upon the Ritz-Galerkin theory, we use it. We show how to modify CG to achieve these extra ortho gonalities. Modifying CG with the suggested changes is non-trivial. Hen ce, we demonstrate that using Recycling CG (RCG) helps us achieve these orthogonalities w ith no code changes. The extra cost of orthogonalizations is often oﬀset by savings because of rec ycling. Our second and third assumptions involve existence, invertibility and boundedness of two ma trices, which are easy to satisfy. While satisfying the backward stability assumptions, by nu merical experiments we show that as we iteratively solve the linear systems arising in the AIRGA algorithm more accurately, we obtain a more accurate reduced system. Experiments are done on an on e dimensional beam model and a Gyroscope model, both of which give rise to Symmetric Posit ive Deﬁnite (SPD) linear systems (as needed because of use of CG/RCG). Since Sparse Approxima te Inverse (SPAI) and Incomplete Cholesky Factorization (ICHOL) are the most general types o f preconditioners, we use both here. By numerical experiments, we also show that recycling Krylo v subspaces helps satisfy the backward stability assumptions (extra-orthogonalities) at almost no extra cost. Key words.

A continuous time-invariant second order linear dynamical system is of the form M¨x(t) =−D˙x(t)−Kx(t)+Fu(t), y(t) =Cpx(t)+Cv˙x(t),(1) whereM, D, K ∈Rn×n, F∈Rn×m,Cp,Cv∈Rq×nare constant matrices.

The mass matrix Mand the stiﬀness matrix Kneed not hold any speciﬁc property (e.g., symmetry, positive deﬁniteness etc.), but only the special ca se of proportional damping is considered. That is, the damping matrix is chosen as D=αM+βKfor some choice of real αandβ. In many cases, the original system dimension nis too large to allow for an eﬃ- cient simulation of ( 1). Therefore, the goal of model reduction is to generate a low dimensional system that has, as best as possible, the same charac teristics as the orig- inal system but whose simulation requires signiﬁcantly less computat ional eﬀort.

Keywords : Genetic va riability, heritability and genetic advance Introduction Field pea ( Pisum sativum L.) is one of the oldest cultivated crops and was grown in farming villages of the China at least as early as 8000 B.C.; but origin of field pea is near the Mediterranean. This plant is a common forage legume in the semiarid regions of the Anatolia and Mediterranean area (rain fall 350 -550mm). It performs best on fertile, well - drained soils with high moisture holding capacity. Optimum growth is obtained on loams, silt loam, or well texture soils with a pH 6.0 -7.5. Pulses have been given the status of ""wonder crop"", as pulses are relatively high in protein content, which makes the diet more balanced in its nutritive value, and their ability to develop a symbiotic relationship in their root nodules with the nitrogen fixing bacteria of rhizobium species to enhance the soil fertility. Field pea ( Pisum sativum L.) is a temperate crop, grown in higher altitudes in tropical areas with temperature ranging between 7 -30 °C. Pulses are the basic ingredient in the diets of a vast majority of the Indian population, as they provide a perfect mix of vegetarian protein component of high biological value when supplemented with cereals. Pulses are also an excellent feed and fodder for livestock . Endowed with the unique ability of biological nitrogen fixation, carbon sequestration, soil amelioration, low water requirement and capacity to withstand harsh climate, pulses have remained an integral component of sustainable crop production system sinc e time immemorial, especially in the dry areas.",600 the pharma innovation journal 2021 10(7): 600-602,600 the pharma innovation journal 2021 10(7): 600-602

ARP poisoning is used when a host is used to poison,"Abstract - Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning is one of the most basic technique employed in computer hacking. ARP poisoning is used when a host is used to poison ARP cache of another host in order to send packets to some other destination than the intended one. This paper presents a feasible technique to detect and prevent the ARP poisoning by removing the multiple entries for the same MAC address or IP address from the ARP table using a secondary cache. This secondary cache contains the entries according to Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) responses. Since this technique prevents multiple entries for same IP address or MAC address, it also mitigates IP exhaustion problem. The secondary cache is maintained at every host which makes this technique distributed in nature, thereby prevents it from single p oint failure. Experimental results are also provided to support the proposal. Keywords - Address Resolution Protocol, ARP Poisoning, IP Exhaustion, Man-in-the-Middle, ICMP, Network Security, Cyber Defense I. INTRODUCTION According to RFC826 [1], the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used by computers to bind logical addresses (IP) to physical addresses (MAC). MAC address works at Data Link Layer of TCP/IP protocol stack. Within LAN, an IP address is translated to a MAC address for the purpose of communication. If IP-MAC binding for a particular host is not present in ARP cache, ARP is used to get and store this binding. ARP involves the exchange of two different types of messages, ARP Request and ARP Reply. ARP Request messages are sent to get the MAC address for a given IP address. ARP Reply messages are sent in response to the ARP request messages. After receiving reply messages, the hosts update their ARP cache with the IP-MAC binding. ARP is an unauthenticated and stateless protocol. It is unauthenticated in the sense that any illegitimate user can send fake ARP Reply messages by spoofing his/her real identity. It is stateless in the sense that anyone can send unsolicited ARP Reply messages even in the absence of corresponding ARP Request messages. ARP poisoning is generally performed to get Man-in- the-Middle (MITM) position. Once an attacker gets MITM position, s/he can launch other fatal attacks, e.g. DoS Attacks, fake DNS replies, etc. Also, s/he can eavesdrop the secure connections using MITM attacks in Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) [2]. These problematic scenarios demonstrate the weaknesses in the ARP operations. As a result, there should be an efficient mitigation approach for the prevention of ARP poisoning which should be robust and compatible with the existing networks. Also, the approach should not give rise to other loopholes which can be exploited for other attacks. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section II discusses the background of ARP protocol and ARP poisoning. In Section III, we discussed the related work done for the mitigation of ARP poisoning attacks. We described our proposed solution in Section IV along with the algorithms and attack scenarios. Results of the experiment are shown in Section V. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper. II. B ACKGROUND A. Address Resolution Protocol In TCP/IP suite, ARP resides in the Data Link Layer while in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, it is often considered as residing between Data Link and Internet Layer. In the Internet Layer of TCP/IP stack, a host is identified by its 32-bit IP address. However, in Data Link Layer, an interface is identified by its 48-bit MAC address. All the packets flowing between different hosts have source address and the destination address. The source address is used to identify th e sender of the packet while the destination address is used to send the packet to the intended destination. Within LAN, the packets are sent using MAC address of the system which has the intended IP address. However, if the destination host belongs to another subnet, the packets are sent to the default gateway. In this case, the destination IP address is used to send the packet to the appropriate network and finally MAC address is used within that network to submit the message to destined host. To resolve the IP address into the MAC address, a host sends a broadcast ARP request. This request is received by every host within the subnet. However, according to the protocol, only the host with the intended IP address replies to the requesting host with its MAC address.

Wire- less sensor networks have several important attributes that require special attention to device design. These include the need for inexpensive, long-lasting, highly reliable de- vices coupled with very low performance requirements.

We have developed a full-system simulator for our sensor node design to verify and explore our architecture. Our simulation results suggest one to two orders of magnitude reduction in power dissipation over existing commodity- based systems for an important class of sensor network ap- plications. We are currently in the implementation stage of design, and plan to tape out the ﬁrst version of our system within the next year. 1. Introduction Wireless sensor networks are poised to transform the way society interacts with the physical world, driven by an explosion of systems research in sensor networks. Sen- sor networks have been proposed and deployed for a wide variety of applications such as habitat monitoring [13, 23], structural monitoring, and emergency medical response [7, 12]. While the application space seems limitless, it is actu- allylimitedbytheoperatinglifetimeofthebattery-operated wireless sensor nodes. Current deployments rely on com- mercially available wireless sensor network devices (e.g., Mica2 [4]). Such devices typically consist of a basic mi- crocontroller,aradio,andavarietyof(oftenMEMS-based) sensors. One of the main limitations of these platforms isthat they are built using commodity chips, which them- selves are not speciﬁcally designed for wireless sensor net- works.Asaresult,theysufferseveralinefﬁcienciesthatlead to high power consumption and limited operational life- times.Toaddressthislimitation,thispaperpresentsthede- sign and analysis of an ultra low power device speciﬁcally forsensornetworkapplications.Inthesesystems,theCPU, radio, and sensor devices are responsible for the majority of the total system power and we show that the general- purposenatureofcommoditymicrocontrollersresultsinin- efﬁcient power usage, presenting an opportunity to signiﬁ- cantly reduce its power. This paper outlines our design approach, which studies all levels of the system design from the applications down to the circuits and even the choice of process technology. This holistic approach enables us to uncover architectural and circuit-level design tradeoffs that guide design deci- sions in order to meet our low power goals and long life- timerequirements.Thepowertargetofthesystemarchitec- tureis100 µWfornormalworkloads.Wechosethispower levelwiththeultimateobjectiveofimplementingatrulyun- tethered device that can operate indeﬁnitely off of energy scavenged from the environment. The intermittent, event-driven nature of sensor network application workloads motivates several architectural de- sign features. We optimize the architecture for frequent, repetitive behavior that is characteristic of sensor network applications. These optimizations include hardware accel- eration and ofﬂoading immediate event handling from the general purpose computing component.

In order to meet the long-lifetime demands of many wire- less sensor network deployments, our architecture enables ﬁne-grain power management to minimize extraneous dy- namic and static power consumption.

Several entities on the Internet do follow this principle. For instance, in this work, we show that many popular web servers on the Internet are generous as they wait for a substantial time period to receive the remaining portion of an incomplete web request. Unfortunately, this behavior also makes them vulnerable to a class of cyber attacks, commonly known as Slow Rate DoS attacks. HTTP/2, the recent version of HTTP , is recently found vulnerable to these attacks. However, the impact of Slow HTTP/2 DoS attacks on real web servers on the Internet has not been studied yet. Also, to the best of our knowledge, there is no defense scheme known to detect Slow Rate DoS attacks against HTTP/2 in real-time. To bridge these gaps, we ﬁrst test the behavior of HTTP/2 supporting web servers on the Internet against Slow HTTP/2 DoS attacks. Subsequently, we propose a scheme to detect these attacks in real-time. We show that the proposed detection scheme can detect attacks in real-time with high accuracy and marginal computational overhead. Index Terms —HTTP/2, Slow Rate DoS attacks, Anomaly detection, DoS F 1 I NTRODUCTION APPLICATION layer Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks are a newer class of DoS attacks that exploit vulnerabilities present in the application layer protocols such as HTTP , NTP , DHCP [1], [2], [3]. These attacks target speciﬁc services (e.g., web, mail, ﬁle transfer) running on a victim computer with a relatively slighter impact on the network resources [4], [5]. One famous example of application layer DoS at- tacks is the Slow Rate DoS attack. Slow Rate DoS attack requires sending multiple incomplete requests to the victim server to consume its connection queue space. Once this ﬁnite space is consumed, the server can not entertain further incoming requests. A few instances of Slow Rate DoS attacks have also been encountered in the past [6], [7]. HTTP/1.1 is one of the most studied protocols against Slow Rate DoS attacks [1], [7]. HTTP/2, the successor of HTTP/1.1, was launched in May 2015 [8], and our HTTP/2 usage measurement study (see Section 4) shows that approximately 71% of the websites serve web con- tent using HTTP/2. The operational differences between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 make the Slow Rate DoS attacks against HTTP/1.1 [1] ineffective against HTTP/2. Likewise, the defense mechanisms known to counter Slow Rate DoS attacks against HTTP/1.1 are ineffective in detecting Slow Rate DoS attacks against HTTP/2. In one of our prior works [9], we performed the vulnerability assessment of HTTP/2, and proposed ﬁve new Slow Rate DoS attacks that are effective against it. However, we tested the attacks in a controlled lab setup only, and we did not observe the behavior of real HTTP/2 web servers against them. Thus, it it is essential to evaluate the effects of Slow HTTP/2 DoS N.

Taking motivation from it, in this work, we test the behavior of HTTP/2 supporting web servers on the Internet against Slow HTTP/2 DoS attacks, and showed that several popular web servers are vulnerable to them1. We also propose a detection mechanism in this work to proactively detect these attacks. We make the following speciﬁc contributions in this paper: We perform a comprehensive Internet-wide study by scanning the top 500K Alexa websites to ﬁnd how many of them support HTTP/2. Our study shows that approximately 71% of the top 500K websites support HTTP/2. We test the behavior of HTTP/2 supporting web servers on the Internet against different Slow HTTP/2 DoS attacks and show that several of them are vulnerable to the attacks. We propose an event sequence analysis-based detec- tion scheme to detect Slow HTTP/2 DoS attacks in real-time. We test the detection performance of the proposed scheme in a real network and show that it can detect attacks with very high accuracy and marginal computational overhead. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We present the HTTP/2 overview and the literature review in Sections 2 and 3. In Sections 4 and 5, we then discuss our study to measure HTTP/2 usage on the Internet and the empirical evaluation of Slow HTTP/2 DoS attacks, respectively. In Section 6, we discuss the proposed detection scheme and 1.

This has led to the depletion of natural resources like coal, wood and kerosene. These sources are inefficient and harmful to the environment. Thus there is an imminent need to replace them with clean, eco -friendly and efficient source of energy. Biogas is an inexhaustible energy source which is clean efficient and environmental friendly, but its efficiency needs to be improved. We have opted the water scrubbing technique along with use of adsorbent such as molecular sieve for the purification of biogas. Water (alkaline) scrubbing removes carbon di oxide, hydrogen sulphide more efficiently than normal water scrubbing and enhances the concentration of methane which promotes easy packing, carriage and storage of biogas thereby enhancing its utility as a fue l. Keywords: Biogas,Combined Method ,Alkaline Water Scrubbing , Adsoption Through Carbon Molecular Sieve, Introduction: The renewable sources of energy are on the verge of being depleted .The present use of fossil fuels is rapidly depleting the natural re serves of coal and natural gas . Theformation of fossil fuels naturally is however a very slow process which takes hundreds and thousands of years. Therefore, a lot of research is being going on to find renewable fuels nowadays to replace fossil fuels. Arenewable fuel keeps environmental balance and contribute to a lesser contribution to the greenhouse effect.The energy crisis in rural areas is increasing. Moreover, the energy demand is growingevery day and the oil prices are increasing every day . Due toabove facts there is need to look for decentralized energy options in rural areas7. Energy from Biomass is one of the most widely used options. With the advancement in new technologies there are various means to convert biomass into energy efficiently. Biogas consists mainly of methane and carbon dioxide and it can be utilized as a renewable energy as a substitute for natural gas. It is produced during anaerobic digestion of organic substrates, such as manure, sewage sludge, the organic wastes of household and industries, and agriculture .",international journal of chemtech research,international journal of chemtech research

Traditional classification approaches deal poorly on content based image classification tasks being one of the reasons of high dimensiona lity of the feature space. In this paper, color image class ification is done on features extracted from histograms of color components. The benefit of using color im age histograms are better efficiency, and insensitivity to sm all changes in camera view-point i.e. translation and rotation. As a case study for validation purpose, experimental trials were done on a database of about 500 images divided into four different classes has been reported and compared on histogram features for RGB, CMYK, La b, YUV, YCBCR, HSV, HVC and YIQ color spaces. Results based on the proposed approach are found encouraging in terms of color image classification accuracy. Keywords: Support Vector Machine, color image histogram, image classification. 1. Introduction Image information systems ar e becoming increasingly important with the advancements in broadband networks, high-powered workstations etc. Large collections of images are becoming available to the public, from photo collection to web pages, or even video databases. Since visual media requires large amounts of memory and computing power for processing and storage, there is a need to efficiently index and retrieve visual information from image database. In recent years, image classification has become an interesting re search field in application. Efficient indexing and retrieval of large number of color images, classification plays an important and challenging role.. The main focus of this research work is devoted to finding suitable representation for images and classification generally requires comparison of images depending on the certain useful features. 2. Image features A number of image featur es based on color and texture attributes have been reported in literature. Although quantifying their discrimination ability to classification problem has not been so easy. Among the many possible features for classification purpose, extracted from an image, we re strict our self to ones which are global and low level features. The simplest way to represent an image is to consider its bitmap representation. More detail is provided ahead. 2.1. Features from Color Histograms In image processing, a color histogram is a representation of the distributio n of colors in an image. For digital images, it is basically the number of pixels that have colors in each of a fixed list of color ranges that span the image color space, the s et of all possible colors. Color histogram technique is a very simple and low level method and in practice it has shown good results [2] especially for image indexing and retrieval tasks, where similar (not necessary identical) images are to be retrieved and easy feature extraction. This also ensures full translation and rotation invarian ce in the color images under classification task. A color is represented by a three dimensional vector corresponding to a position in a color space. This leaves us to select the color space and the quantization steps in this color space. As a color space, first we chose the RGB (Red-Green-Blue). Th e reason for this choice of RGB is that it is widely used in the literature. For the sake of comparison and completeness, we have considered other color spaces also, while keeping other conditions identical. An explanation for this fact is that, after quantization into bins, no information about the color space is used by the classifier.

Dhar, and Nishchal K Verma, Senior Member, IEEE Abstract — In this paper, an event-triggered sliding mode con- trol approach for trajectory tracking problem of nonlinear input affine system with disturbance has been proposed. A second or- der robotic manipulator system has been modeled into a general nonlinear input affine system. Initially, the global asymptotic sta- bility is ensured with conventional periodic sampling approach for reference trajectory tracking. Then the proposed approach of event-triggered sliding mode control is discussed which guaran- tees semi-global uniform ultimate boundedness. The proposed control approach guarantees non-accumulation of control up- dates ensuring lower bounds on inter-event triggering instants avoiding Zeno behavior in presence of the disturbance. The sys- tem shows better performance in terms of reduced control up- dates, ensures system stability which further guarantees optimiz- ation of resource usage and cost. The simulation results are provided for validation of proposed methodology for tracking problem by a robotic manipulator. The number of aperiodic con- trol updates is found to be approximately 44 % and 61 % in the presence of constant and time-varying disturbances respectively. Index Terms— Event-trigger, inter execution time, stability, sliding mode control, trajectory tracking. I. Introduction CONVENTIONAL control theory is usually based on time triggered approach,i.e., periodic sampling of feedback and accomplishment of control law. This approach is well known for its simplicity of analysis. In this approach rate of control law execution does not depend upon system states. Such control approach may be inefficient from computational perspective. An alternate approach known as an event- triggered control has been presented in [ 1]. In event-triggered control, execution of control law is done in aperiodic manner. The control input is computed at events based on condition(s) or threshold value(s) which relies on evolution of system states. Hence, the number of data packets transmitted over network are less which in turn reduces actuator efforts. Event- triggered control makes optimal utilization of resources and improves performance in terms of processing time. Simple event-triggered control approaches have been presented in [2]–[4]. Lunze et al. show state feedback based event-triggered control in [ 5]. Several works in distributed network control system, decentralized sensor networks, consensus con- trol with time delay on event-triggered approach can be re- ferred to [ 6]–[14]. The works presented in [ 15], [16] discuss non-linear event-triggered approach. The uncertainties are unavoidable in real-time control systems. They might adversely affect the performance of system. Hence, their treatment becomes a necessary task. The current state-of-the-art primarily deals with event-triggered strategy for systems without uncertainty or some works have been reported on linear system with uncertainty [ 5], [12], [13]. Uncertainties in system affect the performance of event- triggered control [ 5]. To overcome uncertainty present in system, sliding mode control (SMC) has been used for its good performance [ 17]– [19]. SMC can be used for continuous as well as discrete time system dynamics. For discrete time SMC, steady-state performance of system depends upon sampling time and disturbance bound [ 20]. Li et al. in [ 21] have designed an adaptive sliding-mode stabilization for Markov jump nonlinear systems with actuator faults which guarantees stochastic stability of closed loop system. These works are based on conventional time-triggered approach. Event based SMC have been presented in [ 13], [22] for linear system. These works do not cater to admissibility of control inputs. Admissibility in event-trigger is defined by a bound on inter execution time for update of control law which should be a finite value to ensure system stability. Ferrara and Cucuzzella [23] have shown general results for sliding mode control of first and second order using event-based approach. The paper considers triggering conditions first and then goes for stability analysis of the system in both cases. The triggering conditions are designed using threshold values which are arbitrarily set. The motivation for this work is to develop an approach which reduces usage of various resources and actuator efforts. In addition to it, a controller methodology should take care of system stability, uncertainty and admissibility of control executions. SMC has been extensively studied in recent years but to the best of our knowledge there is dearth of work which analyzes the performance of SMC for trajectory tracking by nonlinear system based on event-triggered approach. This paper puts an effort to present such a controller design by considering the dynamics of robotic manipulator and modeling it into a general nonlinear control affine system. The event-based approach performs at par to the time-triggered controller if not better.

Clustering a high-dimensional protein sequence dataset using traditional machine learning approaches poses many challenges. Many different feature extraction methods exist and are widely used. However, extracting features from millions of protein sequences becomes impractical because they are not scalable with current algorithms. Therefore, there is a need for an efﬁcient feature extrac- tion approach that extracts signiﬁcant features. We have proposed two scalable feature extraction approaches for ex- tracting features from huge protein sequences using Apache Spark, which are termed 60d-SPF (60-dimensional Scalable Protein Feature) and 6d-SCPSF (6-dimensional Scalable Co-occurrence-based Probability-Speciﬁc Feature). The proposed 60d-SPF and 6d-SCPSF approaches capture the statistical properties of amino acids to create a ﬁxed-length numeric feature vector that represents each protein sequence P.

The preprocessed huge protein sequences are used as an input in two clustering algorithms, i.e., Scalable Random Sampling with Iterative Optimization Fuzzy c-Means (SRSIO-FCM) and Scalable Literal Fuzzy C-Means (SLFCM) for clustering. We have conducted extensive experiments on various soybean protein datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed feature extraction methods, 60d-SPF, 6d-SCPSF, and existing feature extraction methods on SRSIO-FCM and SLFCM clustering algorithms. The reported results in terms of the Silhouette index and the Davies-Bouldin index show that the proposed 60d-SPF extraction method on SRSIO-FCM and SLFCM clustering algorithms achieves signiﬁcantly better results than the proposed 6d-SCPSF and existing feature extraction approaches.

ABSTRACT In this paper, an Advanced Quantum-based Neural Network Classi er (AQNN) is proposed. The proposed AQNN is used to form an objectionable Web content ltering system (OWF). The aim is to design a neural network with a few numbers of hidden layer neurons with the optimal connection weights and the threshold of neurons. The proposed algorithm uses the concept of quantum computing and genetic concept to evolve connection weights and the threshold of neurons. Quantum computing uses qubit as a probabilistic representation which is the smallest unit of information in the quantum computing concept. In this algorithm, a threshold boundary parameter is also introduced to nd the optimal value of the threshold of neurons. The proposed algorithm forms neural network architecture which is used to form an objectionable Web content ltering system which detects objectionable Web request by the user. To judge the performance of the proposed AQNN, a total of 2000 (1000 objectionable C1000 non- objectionable) Website's contents have been used. The results of AQNN are also compared with QNN-F and well-known classi ers as backpropagation, support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron, decision tree algorithm, and arti cial neural network. The results show that the AQNN as classi er performs better than existing classi ers. The performance of the proposed objectionable Web content ltering system (OWF) is also compared with well-known objectionable Web ltering software and existing models. It is found that the proposed OWF performs better than existing solutions in terms of ltering objectionable content. INDEX TERMS Quantum computing, Web crawler, neural network classi er, objectionable Web content. I. INTRODUCTION Inspired by the human brain to classify complex patterns of the real world, an arti cial neural network has been intro- duced. In recent decades, many neural architectures have been proposed like Perceptron, Feedforward Neural Net- work, and Backpropagation, etc. These models have been used to solve problems of many areas like mathematics, bio- science, economics, and prediction system [1][5]. The neu- ral network is a mathematical model which performs parallel The associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and approving it for publication was Shirui Pan.information processing by adjusting the connections amongst the number of nodes. However, the performance of the neural network depends on many factors such as network archi- tecture, weights, the number of hidden layer neurons, and learning strategy, etc. [6]. Forming a neural network archi- tecture with optimization of all parameters is a dif cult task. In the neural network learning algorithm, nding optimal connection weights is an important factor for its perfor- mance. For proper selection of these connection weights, several evolutionary algorithms have been proposed [7][12]. To solve the problem of evolving weights of neural network Chen et al.

Related literature on virtual ization in WSNs explored resource optimizat ion without considering communication failure in WSNs environments . The failure of a communication link in WSNs impact s many virtual networks running IoT services. In this context, this paper proposes a framework for optimizing fault tolerance in virtual ization in WSNs , focusing on heterogeneous networks for service -oriented IoT application s. An optimization problem is formulated considering fault tolerance and communication delay as two conflicting objectives . An adapted non-dominated sorting based genetic algorithm ( A-NSGA) is developed to solve the optimization problem . The major components of A-NSGA include chromosome representation, fault toleran ce and delay computation, crossover and mutation, and non -dominance based sorting. Analytical and simulation based comparative performance evaluation has been carried out. From the analysis of results, it is evident that the framework effectively optimizes fault tolerance for virtualization in WSNs . Index Terms –IoT, Virtualization, W ireless sensor networks . I.INTRODUCTION etwork virtualization has got significant attention as an enabling technology for service -oriented heterogeneous network for Internet of Things (IoT) [1]. The rigid communication architecture of Internet is one of challenging issues in IoT . Network virtualization enables Internet to retain its communication architecture while enlarging and transforming as IoT . In IoT enabled smart cities, service - oriented communication architecture is required for smart applications (see Fig.1) . It can be add ressed by implementing network as a service through virtualization [2]. Sensing as a service can be implemented in collaboration with network as a service , to support heterogeneous network ing and sensing resource optimization for smart applications in IoT.

Heterogeneous networks in Internet of Things (IoT) Network virtualization is implemented using virtual network embedding (VNE) algorithms [3]. Due to the inception and evolution of VNE, the role of Internet service provider has been divided into two parts namely, infrastructure provider and service provider. Infrastructure provider is responsible for deployment and maintenance of physical infrastructure whereas, service provider is responsible for range o f customizable services to end user. Various virtual network embedding techniques have been suggested focusing on wired -networks [ 4]. The two key issues in virtual network embedding include resource optimization [ 5], and survivability [ 6]. Due to the rece nt developments in IoT technology, network virtualization in WSNs has been envisioned [7]. Some of the initial works on the virtualization focus es on service -oriented network architecture to optimize sensing resources. An four - layered architecture for virt ualization in WSNs has been suggested , based on reducing redundant deployment of sensor networks for different IoT applications [ 8]. Another five - layered virtualization architecture has been explored to support network diversity and increase resource utili zation in IoT [ 2]. Brain -inspired adaptive architecture has been presented for embedding and running IoT applications on virtual wireless sensor networks [ 9]. The aforementioned architectures did not consider communication failure on virtual networks, caus ed by the communication failure on physical WSNs . The f ault toleran ce (reactive capability of handling communication failure in physical networks) is a pressing issue in virtualization in wired networks [ 10].

With the rapid development of deep learning (DL) networks and GPU’s computing power, the performance of object detectors and trackers has been greatly improved. To understand the main development status of object detection and tracking pipeline thoroughly, in this survey, we have critically analyzed the existing DL network-based methods of object detection and tracking and described various benchmark datasets. This includes the recent development in granulated DL models. Primarily, we have provided a comprehensive overview of a variety of both generic object detection and specific object detection models. We have enlisted various comparative results for obtaining the best detector, tracker, and their combination. Moreover, we have listed the traditional and new applications of object detection and tracking showing its developmental trends. Finally, challenging issues, including the relevance of granular computing, in the said domain are elaborated as a future scope of research, together with some concerns.

In the applications of both real-world and academia, object detection and track- ing has equal importance. Some of the real-world appli- cations include autonomous driving, monitoring security, transportation surveillance, and robotic vision [ 1]. A vari- ety of sensing modalities, such as radar, Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), and computer vision (CV) has become available for object detection and tracking. Imaging tech- nology has immensely progressed in recent years. Cameras are cheaper, smaller and of higher quality than ever before. Concurrently, computing power has dramatically increased. In recent years, computing platforms are geared toward par- allelization such as multi core processing and graphical processing unit (GPU). Such hardware version allows CV for object detection and tracking to pursue real-time imple- mentation. Rapid development in deep convolution neural network (CNN) and GPU’s enhanced computing power are the main reasons behind the fast evolution of CV-based object detection and tracking. In this context, let us mention the evolution of deep learning (DL) from machine learning (ML) and their characteristic differences.

Lot of research has gone into understanding the composi- tion and nature of proteins, still many things remain to be understood satisfactorily. It is now generally believed that amino acid sequences ofproteins are not random, and thus the patterns of amino acids that we observe in the protein sequences are also non-random. In this study, we have attempted to decipher the nature of associations between diﬀerentamino acids that are present in a protein. This very basic analysis pro- vides insights into the co-occurrence of certain amino acids in a protein. Such association rules are desirable for enhancing our understanding ofprotein composition and hold the potential to give clues regarding theglobal interactions amongst some particular sets of amino acids occuring in proteins. Presence of strong non-trivial associations suggests further evidence for non-randomness of protein sequences. Knowledge of theserules or constraints is highly desirable for the in-vitro synthesis of artiﬁ- cial proteins. Keywords: Data mining, quantitative association rule mining, protein composition. 1 Introduction Proteins are important constituents of cellular machinery of any organism. Re- combinant DNA technologies have provided tools for the rapid determinationof DNA sequences and, by inference, th e amino acid sequences of proteins from structural genes [1]. The proteins are sequences made up of 20 types of amino acids. Each amino acid is represented by a single letter alphabet, see Table 1. Each protein adopts a unique 3-dimensional structure, which is decided com- pletely by its amino-acid sequence. A s light change in the sequence might com- pletely change the functioning of the protein. The heavy dependence of protein functioning on its amino acid sequence has been a subject of great anxiety. Research has been done to determine the infor-mation content per amino acid in proteins by Yockey [2] and Strait & Dewey [3]. G.J. Williams and S.J.

N. Sunitha2 BVRIT Hyderabad College of Engin eering for Women, Rajiv Gandhi Nagar, Nizampet Road, Bachupally, Hyderabad, India. Abstract In Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET), the nodes are linked to one another wirelessly and are self sustaining. The member nodes of MANET are very robust and minute. The deployment and maintenance of this network is less expensive and comparatively easy when compared with the conventional networks. However, MANET is highly susceptible to attacks due to its infrastructureless topology. The possible attacks vary over a wide range and affect the network in different levels. To overcome these attacks and safeguard the network performance, in this paper we propose to develop a trusted secure geographical routing protocol for detecting insider attacks. This routing protocol determines the trust value of its neighbouring nodes and based on it, packets are transmitted. The neighbouring nodes are monitored to check if they forward the packets successfully or not. In this way, trustworthy nodes are recorded and the untrustworthy nodes are determined to be malicious. The malicious nodes are omitted from routing process. INTRODUCTION Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) MANET is a self configuring network consisting of highly mobile member nodes which interact with each other. The network processing does not depend on any deployed infrastructure. The mobile nodes which are residing within the communication range of one another detect themselves and link wirelessly. When a node needs to communicate with another node which is not within its transmission range, then the intermediate nodes lying between the source and destination node, forward the packets to other intermediate nodes in the network till it is delivered at the destination.

The compiler converts the specification of a line drawing written in this language into an image file. The language is suitable for drawing line drawings used in scientific literature. Keywords: Line drawing, domain-specific language, graphic language, compiler. 1. Introduction Scientists and engineers are regularly required to draw line drawings. Line drawings appear in books, articles, dissertations and various other documents. Line drawings can be drawn using a wide range of software tools colloquially called graphics editors. Most of the available graphics editors use a canvas -based approach in which a diagram is drawn by dropping and dragging various shapes. This approach is easy to use and requires no training. However, this approach suffers from some drawbacks. It is difficult to draw large or intricate diagrams using the canvas - based approach. Making modifications, even minor ones, is also difficult if the canvas -based approach is used. These problems can be avoided using the alternate domain -specific language based approach. This approach was first used for typesetting technical documents about fifty years ago. In this paper we introduce a domain- specific language, named Line Dr awing Description Language (LDDL), in which the specification of a line drawing can be written. We have implemented a tool that converts such a specification into an image file in the JPEG format. Although non- programmers will require some training to use LDDL, users with some experience in programming can start drawing line drawings using LDDL readily. 2. Related Work In the last fifty years several line drawing languages have been designed. Unfortunately, many of them were described only in in -house tech nical reports which are now difficult to locate. However, there are also a few well -known line drawing languages which require a brief review. In an early study, Frank [1] developed a line drawing language named B -LINE. B -LINE provided a small set of basic graphics statements. Programs were written using these and conventional Fortran statements. A macro -processor converted such a program into a conventional Fortran program. B-LINE was supposed to be used for producing illustrations in the Bell System Techn ical Journal. Around the same time, Kulsrud [2] developed an elaborate compiler- compiler based framework to design line drawing languages. The use of this framework was demonstrated by designing a language whose syntaxes looked like those of an assembly language. The language supported various advanced features like those to analyze and manipulate the diagrams. More than a decade later, van Wyk [3] and Kernighan [4] designed two line drawing languages named IDEAL and PIC, respectively. IDEAL was a well -deve loped procedural language with support for several advanced features like multi -layered pictures. Alternatively, PIC had features of procedural languages and languages processed by preprocessors. Both IDEAL and PIC were processed using preprocessors. Several versions and re -implementations of these languages were also developed in the later years. Additionally, some languages have been also designed for particular subtypes of line drawings like flowcharts, graphs and chemical structures.",gesj: computer science and telecommunications 201 6 no 3(49),gesj: computer science and telecommunications 201 6 no 3(49)

Bootstrapping is the process of implementing a compiler in the language that it is supposed to compile. Alte rnatively, cross -compila tion is the process where a compiler ex ecutes on one computer architecture and gene r- ates target programs to be ex ecuted on another computer archite cture. This note compares and contrasts the two co ncepts. Let us assume that a new computer a r- chitecture has been developed. Software has to be developed for this new co m- puter architecture. However, before any other software program is wri tten for this new computer architecture, language proce ssors like assemble rs and compilers have to be developed. The problem may be defined formally as follows. Let M and N represent an existing computer architecture and a new computer arch i- tecture respectively. Let HLL be a machine -independent high -level la n- guage. Also, let M .ML, N.AL and N.ML represent the machine language of M, a s- sembly language of N and machine la n- guage of N respectively. The objective is to develop a compiler for HLL targeting N, i.e. a compiler that translates HLL i n- to N.ML. This problem may be solved by either bootstrapping or cross -compi - lation. However, both approaches have their own merits and demerits. The problem can be solved using boo t- strapping ideally in two steps. In the first step, a compiler HLL N.ML N.ALC to translate HLL into N. ML is implemented in N.AL. (Note that XY ZC represents a compiler that tran slates a source language X to a target language Y, and is impl emented in a language Z .) We assume that an a s- sembler for N has been already hand - coded in the ma chine language. This is a realistic assumption as impl ementing a compiler in a machine la nguage will be quite forbidding. The compiler HLL N.ML N.ALC will be good enough to pr oduce target programs for N. Ho wever, the compiler will be difficult to modify or debug in future because it is impl emented in an assembly language. So, in the second step, a compiler HLL N.ML HLLC is impl emen- ted. Since th e second compiler is impl e- mented in HLL itself, it will have the desired pro perties of HLL. The two steps are represented in Figure 1 using T-diagrams1. An alternative approach is to use cross -compilation with M being the host computer architecture and N being the target computer architecture. An existing compiler HLL M.ML M.MLC can be reta rgeted to N by modifying its back -end, i.e. the code optimization and code ge neration phases. The compiler HLL N.ML HLLC thus obtained will execute on M but create programs that can be executed on N (Figure 2). In the bootstrapping approach, the source language is the same as the la n- guage of implementation for the second compiler , which is called a self -hosting or self -compiling compiler. This allows the compiler developer to use the sophi s- ticated features of the programing language to implement the compiler. Moreover, the compiler developer need not worry about the possibility of bugs in a compiler written by others. Bootstra p- ping is also a comprehensive test of the program ing language. The bootstra pping approach makes the new computer arch i- tecture self -sufficient in the sense that no other c omputer arch itecture will be needed in future to deve lop software for the new computer architecture. Ho wever, any change in the definition of the source Figure 1. The bootstrapping approach. In step I, a compiler for HLL targeting N is wri tten in the assembly language of N and assembled using a hand -coded assembler. Thus, a working co m- piler is obtained. In step II, the compiler is rewritten in HLL and compiled using the compiler obtained in step I. The result of step II is a self -hosting compiler. Note that a T represents an assembler or a compiler in either source or executable form. The l abels on the left arm, right arm and foot of a T give the source la nguage, target language and language of implementation of the assembler or the compiler respectively. An assembler or a compiler in its executable form can be used to translate the source form of a compiler to its executable form. A T representing the executable -form of a compiler has a triangle below it representing the computer architecture on which the compiler runs. Figure 2. The cross -compilation a pproach. A compiler for HLL targe ting N is written in HLL and compiled using the native compiler on M. A cross -compiler is thus obtained. The cross - compiler runs on M , but generates code for N. The label at the foot of a T representing the executable form of a compiler should be same as the machine language of the computer archite c- ture represented by the triangle b elow it.",current science vol 112 no 5 10 march 2017 906 compiler bootstrapping and cross -compilation,current science vol 112 no 5 10 march 2017 906 compiler bootstrapping and cross -compilation

McKeeman introduced the co n- cept of peephole optimization. This article provid es a brief review of the major peephole optimization tec h- niques identified so far and the methodologies used to implement them. Topics for further research on pee p- hole optimization have been also identified. Keywords: Code generators , compiler s, instruction sequences, peephole optimization . MCKEEMAN1 presented a code optimization technique ‘that consists of a local inspection of the object code to identify and modify inefficient sequences of instructions ’. He also su ggested a name that very well describes this technique – peephole optimization . Code generators in most compilers operate locally pr o- ducing at the best locally optimal object code fragments which may not be efficient when juxtaposed2. The situ a- tion can be improved by peephole optimization. This is typically applied on the object code late in the compil a- tion process. A window or peephole is slid over the object program replacing instruction sequences within the peephole by equivalent but shorter and/or fas ter instru c- tion sequences. The peephole typically consists of 2 –3 contiguous instructions. Peephole optimization can be used for almost all types of programing languages and machine architectures. It takes care of machine - independent as well as machine -specific issues. Peephole optimization is simple, efficient and easy to implement. Unlike most other code optimization techniques, pee p- hole optimization does not make the compiler much hea v- ier or slower. Moreover, the logic behind it can be appreciated by all computer scientists. Consequently, peephole optimization is covered in most textbooks on compiler construction3,4, taught to millions of students in universities around the world, has been used in many r e- search -purpose and production -quality compilers, an d serves as an important topic for research even 50 years after its invention. Common peephole optimization techniques McKeeman1 originally discussed only a few optimization techniques. Later researchers like Bagwell Jr5, Wulf et al.6, and Tanenbaum et al .7 identified many more such peephole optimization techniques (Table 1). These can be grouped as follows. Elimination of redundant instructions Code generators often produce redundant instructions which can be deleted without any side effect. There may be load and store instructions that act on the same data unit even before its value has been modified. Such redu n- dant load and store instructions may be deleted. An unl a- belled instruction sequence following an unconditional jump instruction is unreachable and may be deleted too. A test or a compare instruction not followed by a cond i- tional branch instruction may also be deleted. An inco n- sequential instruction sequence, such as addition of zero or two consecutive negations, may be deleted too. Improvements in fl ow of control An unconditional or a conditional jump instruction pr o- duced by a code generator may have another jump i n- struction as its target. The flow of control of the program can be improved by suitably changing the target address of such a jump instruc tion, and in some cases the second jump instruction may be even deleted. Moreover, if a conditional jump instruction is preceded by a compare or a negation instruction , then the two instructions may be replaced by a new conditional jump instruction that pr e- serves the logic. Algebraic simplifications If a program uses an expression consisting of two or more constants and no variables, then that expression may be evaluated at the compile time only. Some arithmetic i n- structions can be replaced by much simpler instructions on the occurrence of some specific operands. For exa m- ple, x2 can be implemented as x * x and if a square root instruction is available , then x0.5 may be implemented as sqrt( x). Similarly, multiplication by a power of 2 may be implemented as le ft-shift, division by a power of 2 may be implemented as right -shift, addition of 1 may be i m- plemented as increment, subtraction of 1 may be impl e- mented as decrement, and multiplication or division by –1 may be implemented as negation. Logic expressions may be simplified at the compile time using the concepts of Boolean algebra like the De Morgan ’s laws.

Spending a large amount of time on smartphone might lead to a dependence on it for a variety of purposes. This study uses objective measures of real time smartphone usage features to assess smartphone addiction. A purpose built android application to collect real time smartphone usage has been developed and linear classification models namely Suppo rt Vector Machine and L ogistic Regression are used to predict sm artphone addiction among university students. Furthermore, correlation and information gain measures are used to identify most vital features of smartphone usage which contribute maximum in assessment of smartphone addiction. It has been observed that both the linear models give worthy performance with more than 80% of accuracy. Also, the most important technical features impacting smartphone addiction are longest session spent for entertainment, total time used for communication, longest session spent for communication, longest session spent for work, total time used for entertainment, longest session for news and surfing, and data usage in other activities. Index Term s: Smartphone addiction, machine learning, linea r classification, android application . 1. Introduction Smartphone usage has become inevitable with phones becoming an integral part of lifestyle servin g multiple purposes such as communications, social networking, media streaming, information retrieval, etc. Spending significant amounts of time using smartphones for numerous activities potentially develop dependency on them for numerous purposes which may lead to addictive usage and development of associated psychological disorders [ 1,2]. There are many impairments associated with excessive and addictive used of smartphones such as increase in the risk of sleeping disturbance and stress, sensation of be ing less physically active, fall in mental h ealth and even depression [3 ].

This is partic u- larly true in relation to M. tuberculosis . The time is now propitious to initiate concerted efforts in th e area of structure - based inhibitor design. Efforts with emphasis on validated targets should ce r- tainly be encouraged. In add ition, it is also important to support the more holi s- tic approaches of the type ou tlined above. Apart from other things, there is a crying need to develop drugs for infe c- tious diseases , including TB. India now has the competence to contribute su b- stantially to addressing this need. In this note, I have focused on structure -based efforts, as I am particularly fami liar with them. Our ef forts in this area should i n- volve proven paradigms as well as mod i- fied or new paradigms. In the present context, the adage ‘let a hundred flowers bloom and let a hundred ideas co ntend’, should guide us. 1. Vijayan, M. , Curr. Sci. , 2003, 85, 878 – 885. 2. Kumar, R. A., Vaze, M.

Pinaki Chakraborty It will not be an exagger ation if I say that today we live in the age of co mputers. We are surrounded by computers and other programable devices. A lmost all software programs that run on these devices are written in high -level pr ogra- ming languages like C, C++ and Java. These programing languages allow sof t- ware developers to specify what the pr o- gram is supposed to do in a human intelligible form. This property of the high-level pr ograming languages makes it convenient for software developers to write and debug programs. Unfort u- nately, computers understand none of these high -level programing la nguages. A computer can only run a program wri t- ten in its machine language. A machine language is a machine -specific low -level language, and is difficult to understand and use by software develo pers. So, a special type of software pr ogram called compilers is used to bridge the gap b e- tween the high -level programing la n- guages and th e machine languages. A compiler translates a pr ogram written by a software developer in a high -level pr o- graming language into machine la n- guage. The first realistic compiler was deve - loped by a team led by John W. Backus in 1957. That compiler translated programs written in the FORTRAN (FORmula TRAN slation) programing language into the machine la nguage of the then latest IBM 704 computers. When th e develo p- ers were commissioned to develop that compiler, they hardly had any idea of the difficulty of the project which they e x- pected to complete within six months. However, they ended up consuming two and half years of time and 18 man -years of effort to complete the project. Their experience taught two important lessons to the computer sc ience community. First, compi lers are complex programs and a subject called ‘compiler constru c- tion’ should be formally established. Second, and more importantly, compiler s are useful software pr ograms that can revolutionize the art of computer pr o- graming. Serious research and r epeated development activ ities over the years have by now standardized the structure and the internal working of compilers. However, both high -level programing languages and computer a rchitectures have been evolving contin uously since 1957. Cons equently, compilers have been forced to evolve too. A few years ago while studying at Jawaharlal Nehru University, I once heard a senior professor from another premier university in India, who was d elivering an invited talk in a conference in our university, make a passing remark that nobody works on compi lers an ymore. So, is compiler construction a dead subject? Courses on compiler constru ction are taught in both undergraduate and pos t- graduate -level computer e ngineering programs in most unive rsities in India. However, these courses are often taught in a d ry and uninteresting manner with either little or absolutely no laboratory support. Moreover, hardly anybody does research on compilers in India. However, things are quite different abroad, esp e- cially in the top universities. There are active research grou ps working on com- pilers. Courses on compiler construc tion are taught based on a program ing exe r- cise. This programing exercise is o ften the largest and the most sophisticated program that computer e ngineers write in their student life. There are quite a f ew reasons for studying compiler construction and researching compilers. A decent know - ledge of compilers helps software deve - lopers to write programs with desired characteristics like small size when translated into machine language, less running time, b etter fault tolerance and low power consumption.

Bhatia Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Netaji Subhas University of Technology, Delhi, India *Corresponding author doi: https://doi.org/10.21467/proceedings.114.11 Abstract Excessive use of smartphones throughout the day having dependency on them for social interaction, entertainment and information retrieval may lead users to develop nomophobia. This makes them feel anxiou s during non -availability of smartphones. This study describes the usefulness of real time smartphone usage data for prediction of nomophobia severity using machine learning. Data is collected from 141 undergraduate students analyzing their perception abou t their smartphone using the Nomophobia Questionnaire (NMP -Q) and their real time smartphone usage patterns using a purpose - built android application. Supervised machine learning models including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines, Naïve Bayes and K -Nearest Neighbor are trained using two features sets where the first feature set comprises only the NMP -Q features and the other comprises real time smartphone usage features along with the NMP -Q features. Performance of these models is evalua ted using f -measure and area under ROC and It is observed that all the models perform better when provided with smartphone usage features along with the NMP -Q features. Naïve Bayes outperforms other models in prediction of nomophobia achieving a f -measure value of 0.891 and ROC area value of 0.933. Keywords: machine learning, nomophobia, smartphone addiction, real time data Introduction Smartphones usage has grown to an extent where the phones have become an integral part of everyone’s lives. Today smartph ones are used throughout the day for multiple purposes including communication, productivity, utilities, and even entertainment, social networking, and gaming. The easy availability of smartphones and the Internet and the flexible schedules of millennials is leading them to excessive and addictive smartphone usage behaviors. Smartphone addiction is a shifting technological addiction as the mobile phones have evolved to smartphones encompassing varied Internet features and applications [1]. Smartphone addict ion refers to overuse of smartphones with corresponding functional impairments. Strong evidences of smartphone addiction on adverse effects on academic performance of university students has been studied [1]. Recent investigations have explored novel psych ological disorder associated with smartphone addiction which is termed as nomophobia. Nomophobia is the abbreviation of No Mobile Phone Phobia which is defined as a disorder of millennials which includes nervousness, distress and/or anxiety caused by the n on-availability of smartphone [2, 3, 4]. Nomophobia is an outcome of excessive use of smartphones leading to its dependency for social networking and information retrieval. It arises from fear of losing connection with people, losing internet connectivity and access to social networking, and losing access to online information [5] leading to nomophobic people being anxious in such situations. Such people tend to keep their phone switched on 24 hours a day and even take their phone to bed contributing to nig ht time usage and causing sleep disorders. Nomophobia has been studied to impact psychological, social, academic, and professional lives of smartphone users [1, 6]. Recently many researchers have attempted to assess nomophobia and to study its various a spects and dimensions using different methods [2 -5, 7-15].

Such devices are at times used by parents and relatives to video -chat with young children. P aediatr icians and developmental psychologists earlier used to not recommend the use of screen - based devices by children younger than 2 years. However, video -chatting with pa r- ents and relatives is now considered safe for young children1. Consequently, attemp ts are being made to determine the popula rity of video -chatting among young children and to understand the utility of the same2. We conducted a study in New Delhi in February 2017 to check the i nterest and ability of children younger than 2 years with reg ard to video -chatting . We found that only a small proportion of parents feel the need for, and engage in, video - chatting with their children. We ident i- fied 12 children younger than 2 years who engaged in video -chatting at least once a week. We visited thes e children at their homes, interviewed their parents and observed them while they were video -chatting. The behavio ur of a child towards video -chatting varies with time and co n- text. However, there are some salient trends in their behavio ur. First, a child can knowingly take part in a video -chat by the age of 12 months. By the age of 18 months, he/she starts touching the screen and the keyboard, if there is one, of the device mimicking adults. Ho w- ever, as expected, a child cannot control the d evice even at the age of 24 months and hence cannot initiate a video -chat on his/her own. Second, a child shows inte r- est in video -chatting with those whom he/she has met in person. While video - chatting with such a person, a child demonstrates a steady head, eye gaze, use of a variety of gestures and low distractibility. Third, a child is more interested in the audio pa rt of the chat rather than in what he/she sees . Neve r- theless, a child participates more a ctively in a video -chat than in a phone call , as also observed by McClure et al.3. A child shows interest in video -chatting with a person who is r esponsive and speaks contingently. Fourth, a child ge nerally does not show much interest in video - chatting with those whom he/she has never met in person, and the situation does not improve even after several video -chat sessions. A child cannot recognize those whom he/she has seen and heard only in video -chats ’ in person for the first time. Fifth, the attention span of a child t owards a video -chat typically ranges from 5 s to 2 min, and increases gradually with age and exper i- ence. We observed that video -chatting is not much useful to soothe a crying child. However, it is suitable for a parent who is away to interact with a child. Video - chatting can instill a sense of proximity and security in chi ldren, as also observed by Tarasuik et al .4. A parent may also use video -chatting from his /her office to keep track of a child who is in a crèche or at home with a caregiver. Video - chatting may also be used by relatives and family friends to be in touch with a child. 1. American Academy of Pediatrics , Pedia t- rics, 2016, 138, article e 20162591. 2.

Though art i- ficial borders are occasionally impo rtant, creating a border because of personal greed or jealousy must be avoided. The history of partition of our country is a well -known example. India is a vast country with differences among the people with regard to their language, culture, religion, appearance and habits, which provide avenues for the creation of artificial borde rs. Therefore, our policies must be such that they reinforce faith among fellow citizens for solidarity of the n ation. It is pertinent to note that sc ience in India is carried out using tax payers’ money. Therefore, scie ntists have to put aside their per sonal biases and come forward to play a bigger role in maintaining national integrity. I agree with Arunan1 that either the three Sc ience Academies merge or they can manage the different branches of science separately in this large country. 1.

The PV system is integrated to grid through a voltage source inverter (VSI), in which PV- VSI combination supplies active power and compensates reactive power of the local non-linear load connected to the point of com- mon coupling (PCC). For extraction of maximum power from the PV panel, we develop a RL based maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm. The instantaneous power theory (IPT) is adopted for generation reference inverter current (RIC). An SMC algorithm has been developed for injecting current to the local non-linear load at a reference value. The RL-SMC scheme is implemented in both simulation using MATLAB/SIMULINK software and on a prototype PV experimental. The performance of the proposed RL-SMC scheme is compared with that of fuzzy logic-sliding mode control (FL-SMC) and incremental conductance-sliding mode control (IC-SMC) algorithms. From the obtained results, it is observed that the proposed RL-SMC scheme provides better maximum power extraction and active power control than the FL-SMC and IC-SMC schemes.

I NTRODUCTION HARVESTING maximum possible power from a solar PV system and then connecting it to the utility grid is a challenging task owing to intermittent nature of solar PV system, like variation of solar insolation and temperature. Many MPPT techniques have been implemented for extrac- tion of maximum power from the PV system, which can be categorized in to indirect method and direct method [1]. Indirect methods use the database like parameters, PV array characteristic curves at different insolation and temperature for extraction of maximum power. The indirect method include curve ﬁtting [2], look up table [2], open circuit voltage [2], short circuit current [3]. Indirect methods are not suitable in case of changing atmospheric conditions. Direct methods include the methods, which use the voltage current measure- ment of PV panel, such as hill climbing [2], perturb and observe (P&O) [2], incremental conductance [4], fuzzy logic (FL), artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), SMC. However, hill climbing and P&O MPPT algorithm encounter serious problem such as oscillations at the MPP due to continuous perturbations and reduced efﬁciency [5]. Further, another demerit of P&O is that, it is sensitive to changing atmospheric condition in [6]. IC MPPT algorithm has a serious recursion near the MPP [7]. FL control based MPPT offers fast tracking and expert knowledge is required to design fuzzy parameters [8]. On the other hand, AI based MPPT algorithms have been reported in [9].

This ASMC algorithm minimizes the difference between the reference inverter current and the actual inverter current of the grid connected PV system (GCPVS) during unbalanced loading, grid voltage distortion and variation in solar irradiance. The maximum output power from the PV panel is obtained using modified incremental conductance (IC) MPPT algorithm. Instantaneous power theory (IPT) is employed to transfer active power and reactive power between the PV system, grid and the non-linear load. The ASMC-IC-IPT control scheme is applied to a grid connected PV system firstly using simulation and then on a prototype experimental setup. The performance of ASMC-IC-IPT scheme is compared with that of sliding mode control (SMC)-IC-IPT scheme. From the obtained results, it is observed that ASMC-IC-IPT control scheme outperforms the SMC-IC-IPT control scheme during transient, steady state and dynamic loading conditions.

Introduct Ion IN view of the load disturbance and uncertainties in para- meters e.g. voltage, current, resistance, inductance of a grid connected PV system, designing an appropriate control algorithm is important. Also a number of non-linear control algorithms have been proposed for a PV system such as Lyapunov based controller [1], two-loop controller, SMC controller [2]. Among the aforesaid non-linear control algorithms, SMC algorithm is popular due to its robustness in face of parametric uncertainties and load variations. However, the SMC algorithm yields chattering in the control signal resulting reduction in control accuracy and high heating losses in the power circuit [3]. Sliding mode observer based adaptive slip ratio control algorithm is proposed in [4] for a hybrid electric vehicle. In [5], the adaptive global fast terminal SMC using fuzzy neural network approaches are proposed for an H-bridge inverter. An adaptive fuzzy SMC [6] is proposed for a two stage single-phase grid connected PV system. An adaptive SMC is also developed for a single-phase grid connected PV system in [7]. The contribution of this paper lies in designing an ASMC- IC-IPT scheme for a three-phase grid connected PV system.

Since, payload is a critical parameter of the FLM whose variation greatly inﬂuences the controller performance. The proposed controller guarantees stability under change in payload by attenuating the non-modeled higher order dynamics using a new nonlinear autoregressive moving average with exogenous-input (NARMAX) model of the FLM. The parameters of the FLM are identiﬁed on-line using recursive least square (RLS) algorithm and using minimum vari- ance control (MVC) laws the control parameters are updated in real-time. This proposed NSPID controller has been implemented in real-time on an experimental set-up. The joint tracking and link deﬂection performances of the proposed adaptive controller are compared with that of a popular direct adaptive controller (DAC). From the obtained results, it is conﬁrmed that the proposed controller exhibits improved performance over the DAC both in terms of accurate position tracking and quick damping of link deﬂections when subjected to variable payloads. Index Terms —Flexible-link manipulator, position control, self- tuning control, NARMAX, trajectory tracking. I. I NTRODUCTION MAJOR challenge in manipulator control is to obtain good accuracy in positioning of the end effector. Rigid- link manipulators possess high structural stiffness. However, these manipulators are quite inefﬁcient in terms of high speed operation and low energy consumption. Also they are unsafe to humans due to high inertia. Alternatively, ﬂexible-link manipulators can be used in which inertia is less as a result it gives low energy consumption and high-speed operation [1]. But, while the aforesaid beneﬁts are achieved, control of Flexible-link manipulators (FMLs) becomes difﬁcult due to execution of following two tasks namely, rigid body position control and suppression of link-deﬂection [2]. When a FLM is subjected to an unknown environment due to change in payload it further affects the performance of the feedback control system [3] −[5].

Digital Object Identiﬁer DOI: 10.1109/JAS.2017.7510871objective of the present work is to design an indirect self- tuning PID controller with following objectives: (a) it should exhibit good joint position tracking (b) it ability to estimate on- line higher-order dynamics due to change in payload and (c) it should also suppress the link-deﬂection considerably. There have been numerous attempts in last three decades to design indirect adaptive controllers for FLMs. One of the earliest works reported in [6], [7], was on indirect adaptive controller applied to a FLM system using linear identiﬁcation. However, the above adaptive controller in [6], [7] has a very limited application for large value of payloads. In [8], [9], a self-tuning controller (STC) for a two-link non-rigid manipulator was designed. But, due to the limitation in the identiﬁcation method structure, there was a discrepancy during experimental valida- tion. To overcome the complexity of neglecting dynamics of higher order for a FLM, an algebraic identiﬁcation based STC was proposed in [10], which was subsequently extended for unknown loads and large payloads with an indirect controller ensuring closed-loop stability. The work in [11] was further extended for large payloads in [12]. A series of simulation and experimental results established that linear identiﬁed model based STC can be used for FLM when subjected to variable loads. But, the link deﬂection was still a problem, ﬁrst time an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model was used to design a STC control in [13] for a single-link ﬂexible manipulator with RLS algorithm to estimate the parameters of this model. Next, a camera was used to control the tip position in designing an adaptive controller using simple decoupled self-tuning control law comprising of the estimation of links natural frequency for a single link ﬂexible manipulator in [14]. This work was further extended by adding another sensor called accelerometer and strain gauges in [15]. Recently, there is successful effort to design intelligent PI controllers for FLMs when subjected to variable payloads [16]. Indirect adaptive controllers using a linear model fail to achieve precise real-time adaptive controller for FLM, for different payloads. Further complexity increases if the number of links increases, which gives rise to a multivariable nonlinear system. There are efforts to design nonlinear STC for nonlinear system in [17] and a multivariable STC-PID controller using minimum variance control law in [18]. To incorporate an identiﬁcation technique for estimating these parameter uncertainties, the focus is to design an indirect controller using a nonlinear estimated model with help of a self-tuning controller. The nonlinear autoregressive model is a popular nonlin- ear modeling paradigm since, it requires lesser number of parameters to describe nonlinear system dynamics compared to nonlinear time series representation. Hence, it involves",136 ieee caa journal of automatica sinica vol 7 no 1 january 2020,136 ieee caa journal of automatica sinica vol 7 no 1 january 2020

This proposed adaptive controller consists of a proportional derivative (PD) tracking loop and an actor-critic-based RL loop that adapts the actor and critic weights in response to payload variations while suppressing the tip deﬂection and tracking the desired trajectory. The actor-critic-based RL loop uses a recursive least square (RLS)-based temporal difference (TD) learning with eligibility trace and an adaptive memory to estimate the critic weights and a gradient-based estimator for estimating actor weights. Tip trajectory tracking and suppression of tip deﬂection performances of the proposed RL-based adaptive controller (RLAC) are compared with that of a nonlinear regression-based direct adaptive controller (DAC) and a fuzzy learning-based adaptive controller (FLAC). Simulation and experimental results envisage that the RLAC outperforms both the DAC and FLAC. Note to Practitioners— This paper shows how to control a system with distributed ﬂexibility. The reinforcement learning approach to develop adaptive control described in the paper can be applied to control also complex ﬂexible space shuttle system and for damping of many vibratory systems.

I. I NTRODUCTION FLEXIBLE-LINK MANIPULATORS (FLMs), i.e., ma- nipulators with thin and lightweight links offer several advantages over rigid-link manipulators such as achieving high-speed operation, lower energy consumption, and in- crease in payload carrying capacity. These nonconvectional manipulators ﬁnd applications requiring large workspace like assembly of free-ﬂying space structures and hazardous material management from safer distance [1]. All these advantages and applications motivate towards the accelerated research in FLM control. However, controlling a FLM is difﬁcult owing to distributed link ﬂexibility which makes this type of manipulator system dynamics nonminimum phase and underactuated [1]. Further, control of a FLM becomes more challenging when it has to handle variable payload. In order to achieve good tip trajectory tracking while suppressing tip deﬂection with varied payloads, adaptive control should be employed, which can provide appropriate control torques to the actuators to achieve the above two-control tasks (good tip trajectory tracking and suppression of tip deﬂection). In the past, several papers on design of adaptive controllers for FLMs with variable payloads have been reported. A simple decoupled adaptive controller comprising of the estimation of link’s natural frequency for a single link ﬂexible manipulator under variable payload is proposed in [2].

This work is based on Artiﬁcial Neural Netwo rk as well as on Suppor t Vector Machine (SVM) concept. As th e load of sensing reso urce is reduced signiﬁcantly, this appro ach will save the ener gy of the nodes, and also reduce the s ensing time dramatica lly.

In this paper, we quantitatively (mathematically) reason the energy saving s achieved by the Leveling and Sectoring protocol .

As the networks find implementation in such a huge diversity of applications, the demand for efficiency has increased. The efficiency of sensor networks is d efined in terms of network performance [2]. Regardless, the question of desirable performance depends upon a number of characteristics some of which are high throughput, ne t- work longevity and quality of service [ 10]. One of the important characteristic whi ch has stimulated the interest is the energy efficient operation of the network. Incidenta l- ly, a major constraint in the case of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is the limited power supply. Hence, it becomes crucial that energy is used in an efficient mann er without neglecting the output of the network. The monitoring of energy consumption will contribute in an optimal performance of the network. The sensor nodes in a WSN are responsible for sensing the environmental info r- mation and reporting the same to th e Base Station (BST) . Hence, reliable routing of data is one of the major tasks in WSNs .

It gives information about sp ectrum availabilitybyscanningthebands.Usuallyaﬁxed amountof time is given to scan individual bands. Most of the times, histori cal information about the trafﬁc in the spectrum bands is not use d. But this information gives the idea, how busy a speciﬁc band i s. Therefore, instead of scanning a band for a ﬁxed amount of tim e, more time can be given to less occupied bands and less time to heavily occupied ones. In this paper we have formulated the t ime assignment problem as integer linear programming and sourc e coding problems. The time assignment problem is solved usin g the associated stochastic optimization problem.

INTRODUCTION In recent years, Cognitive Radio technology [1] is proposed for making efﬁcient utilization of electromagnetic spectr um. At the physical layer of cognitive radio networks, various techniques are proposed for Spectrum Sensing [2]. One of the basic approaches to spectrum sensing is based on Energy Detection. In earlier efforts of spectrum sensing, the temp oral record/history of spectrum utilization has been completel y ignored. Some researchers realized that such approach to spectrum sensing is sub-optimal[3]. The authors particula rly proposed Doubly Cognitive Network Architecture in which Intelligent Spectrum Sensing is carried out by taking the historical data of spectrum utilization into account. In th is research paper, we make precise mathematical formulation of time optimal spectrum sensing and propose an interesting solution. II. TIMEOPTIMALSPECTRUM SENSING: INTEGERLINEAR PROGRAMMING Consider a band of EM spectrum available for wireless communication. Let this band be subdivided into sub-bands labeled1,2,...,M. In traditional spectrum sensing based on, say, energy detection, all the sub-bands are scanned wit h a ﬁxed, constant time irrespective of the historical data ab out packet trafﬁc. It is logically clear that the sub bands which are heavily occupied(based on historical trafﬁc data) can b e scanned faster(sensing time is chosen to be smaller) while t he less occupied sub-bands can be scanned using larger sensing time. The total available time for spectrum sensing of theentire band is assumed to be constant, say L seconds. The sensing time allocated for each of the sub bands is assumed to be integer valued. Note:The time optimal spectrum sensing problem formulated below does not depend on the spectrum sensing approach. Joint Detection-Estimation Approach to Spectrum Sensing: In the following discussion we formulate the problem of prediction of packet trafﬁc based on historical data as a Linear Mean Square Estimation problem. Also as in traditional spectrum sensing primary user detection i s formulated as hypothesis testing based detection problem. As discussed earlier, we take the historical trafﬁc data on various sub-bands into account for choosing the spectrum sensing time. In this direction we model the historical traf ﬁc data as an Auto Regressive(AR) process. In time, the unit on which the data is collected, could be an hour, day, month etc. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁt a pthorder AR process to the trafﬁc data, i.e. x(n+p) =a1x(n)+a2x(n+1)+... +apx(n+p−1)+w(n+p)(1) where using LMSE(Linear Mean Square Error estimation i.e. Solving Yule-Walker equations) method, the coefﬁcients ar e estimated and the trafﬁc data is predicted(on certain time unit). Note:The prediction tool(model) can be chosen to be more sophisticated (artiﬁcial Neural network based approach). Let the predicted data in M sub-bands be denoted by n1,n2,...,n M. We normalize the number of packets in various sub-bands in the following manner qi=ni/summationtextM j=1njfor1≤i≤M (2) Thus{q1,q2,...,q M}is a probability mass function, associated with packet trafﬁc data in various sub-bands. Now, we formulate the time-optimal spectrum sensing problem . Our goal is to allocate the total time for sensing the entire band ( say L seconds ) into time for sensing sub-",garimella rama murthy1 rhishi pratap singh2 samdarshi abhijeet3 and sachin chaudhary4,garimella rama murthy1 rhishi pratap singh2 samdarshi abhijeet3 and sachin chaudhary4

I NTRODUCTION 16 THE rapid growth of wireless communication technology 17 has led to the development of low power, low cost 18 and tiny sensor nodes. Each tiny node has the capacity to 19 sense, process, and to transmit the sensed data to base station. 20 Randomly deployed tiny nodes form a network for data 21 transmission. These Networks have become extremely popular 22 due to the large number of applications in the areas of intrusion 23 detection, habitat, environmental monitoring, etc. However, 24 some of the limitations of sensor nodes are mainly in storage 25 capacity, power capacity, and short communication range [1]. 26 These limitations can be overcome by some efﬁcient sensor 27 node placement schemes and hiera rchical implementations [2]. 28 Secure data transmission and low energy consumption is 29 possible through choices of Cluster Heads (CHs) in the 30 wireless sensor ﬁeld [3]. The entire sensor ﬁeld is divided 31 into several small ﬁelds known as clusters and each one is 32 headed by a cluster head [16]. Among cluster heads, some 33 are important and others are ordinary CHs. These important 34 cluster heads transfer data between a base station and other 35 cluster heads. 36 In Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), the cluster head 37 placement problems have not been adequately studied in the 38 literature, while secure placement of nodes in sensor ﬁeld has 39 Manuscript received September 26, 2019; revised October 17, 2019; accepted November 2, 2019.

Motivation :Wireless 40 Sensor Networks ﬁnd many applications in ﬁelds such as 41 Military Communication, healthcare etc. 42 •Security Constraint: Speciﬁcally, in the case of commu- 43 nications among military personal, certain messages can 44 be received by ofﬁcers of certain cadre and above (in the 45 military hierarchy) only. 46 •Optimization Constraint: Also, it is clear that messages 47 will have delay constraint and must be received by 48 ofﬁcers in real time. 49 In this letter, we propose a novel optimal approach for the 50 sensor placement in WSNs. The main goal is to minimize 51 average depth of Important Cluster Heads from the base station 52 by reducing the number of hops. Further, we ensure message 53 security and make, the paths from Base Station (BS) to Impor- 54 tant Cluster Heads to be preﬁx-free.

S YSTEM MODEL 66 The entire system structure is based on the approaches made 67 for an optimal, energy efﬁcient and secure wireless sensor 68 network. To minimize the average depth of an ICH from the 69 BS in terms of hop-count, to provide an optimal hierarchy in 70 the network for secure data transmission, and to relate CH 71 placement and source coding t echnique are the three main 72 proposals required for an efﬁcient network design. 73 •Based upon hierarchy among military personnel, impor- 74 tance values are assigned/decided 75 •The total number of important cluster heads is decided 76 by a number of ofﬁcers in the military hierarchy 77 We realized that the above motivation can be understood by 78 modeling the real-time communication problem as a source 79 coding problem.

These nodescoordinate to perform distributed sensing in various ﬁelds suchas health, military, home etc. But these small devices in WirelessSensor Network (WSN) are still limited with some constrains,and efforts are required to increase the lifetime and otherperformance measures of the network. On the other hand, withrecent advances in Cognitive Radio (CR) technology, it is possibleto apply the Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) model in WSNsto get better throughput, even in congested spectrum alongwith better propagation characteristics. This paper proposes anovel architecture for Cognitive-WSN which consists of a Forestof Distributed Minimum Spanning Trees. Paper also showsthat this multilevel network provides fault tolerance, admitssimple routing, and offers easy extensibility with power efﬁciency. Index Terms - Wireless Sensor Network, Cognitive WSN, Architecture, Cognitive Radio, Dynamic Spectrum Access. I. I NTRODUCTION A general Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) consists of a set of sensor nodes that are deployed in a ﬁeld and interconnected with a wireless communication network. Each sensor node ismade up of sensing unit, data processing unit, communication unit and power unit. Components of a sensor node are shown in ﬁgure 1. Each of these scattered sensor nodes has thecapabilities to collect data, and route the data back to the sink/base station [1], [2]. PowerProcessor Storage Power UnitADC SensorProcessing Unit Sensing Unit Transceiver Generator Fig. 1. The Components of a Sensor Node In many applications, it is impractical to recharge nodes after they are deployed, as WSN nodes do not receive personal human interaction/care and usually get deployed in ﬁeld atrandom unknown locations. Thus sensor nodes show strong dependence on battery life. In WSN, each node plays the dual role of data collector and data router, hence malfunctioningof few nodes can cause signiﬁcant topological changes. It might require rerouting of packets and reorganization of thecomplete network. Hence, energy efﬁcient communication isvery signiﬁcant constraint in WSN. Most WSN operate in unlicensed frequency bands which are also used by other wireless applications, such as Wi-Fiand Bluetooth. This makes unlicensed bands overcrowded. To reduce network congestion, Dynamic Spectrum Allocation (DSA) can be used in such scenarios. Since sensors have limited power, we assume that some specialized nodes areresponsible for spectrum sensing and they forward the spec- trum availability information to the base station [3]–[6]. Base station can later use this information to assign non-overlappingfrequencies to neighboring sensor nodes. This paper proposes a novel architecture for Cognitive-WSN and also shows that the proposed network architecture is power efﬁcient. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II explains the proposed network structure using referencefrom previously proposed network architectures. Section III discusses the process ﬂow required to deﬁne and use the proposed network structure. And ﬁnally, Section IVsummarizes the work done. II. P ROPOSED NETWORK ARCHITECTURE This section explains the proposed network structure with reference to other already present in the literature. To reducecomplexity of ﬁnal architecture, neighboring nodes have been clustered together. We have divided the sensor nodes into several clusters in the sensed area. Each cluster chooses acluster head automatically. Nodes belonging to a cluster send data to their cluster head. After receiving data from all member nodes, the cluster head transmits the data to sink and/or toother cluster heads. Hence the problem of deﬁning the network structure can be divided into two smaller problems. First problem is trying to represent nodes in one cluster as onestructure and second is to represent network of clusters as one uniﬁed super-structure. Normally cluster head is at one-hop distance from other member nodes belonging to the same cluster. Cluster head and other member nodes together form a simple, star-likeconnection as shown in ﬁgure 2. In this representation routing is very simple; every sensor node sends data directly to the cluster head. Once cluster head receives data from all thesensor nodes in cluster, fusion algorithms are applied on the received data.

From the initial si mulation it is estimated that the routing errors using a distributed algorithm for a large network is less susceptible to failures when comp ared to using a table driven routing algorithm. To further address other inﬂuencing factors which are not related to resource allo cation or routing of the sensor network we study the correlated issues, which makes sensor network unique to the categories of wireless network applications. The simulation results show that due to 1 -bit-mask accuracy and the CDF codes used to represent mea sured values in the decoder buffer is fault -tolerant and also increases the communication rate by 70% due to information redundancy within a sensor cluster . Keywords —Sensor Data Reliability, Slepian & Wolf Coding, Cosets, Huffman Trees, BER, Baysian Error . I.mINTRODUCTION Sensor networks are deployed in a dense configuration due to its limited radio range and fixed non renewable energy resources due to computational/networking characteristics of sensor networks. To collaboratively use the limited resources distributed algor ithms, select a single node which transmits serially using its UART pre -processed sensed data information using many local resources. As the cost of radio transmission is much more than local sensing, the sensor network uses two different topologies to add ress the energy cost at the cross - layer stack. The network layers uses the upper layers assuming MAC layer abstraction to optimally pick cluster heads by using a fixed probability density function (pdf) of a network resource at the node, such as, remainin g battery energy. This type of pdf is power -aware as it uses a collaborative function to minimize over use of network resources thus avoiding pre -mature node failures. The MAC layer uses a k -neighborhood distance algorithm to find other nodes within its own limited range and uses a multi -hop schedule to the specific data transmitting node. This scheduling allows multi -hop nodes to use sleep cycles and lower their energy consumption while idling. These multi - hop algorithms u se low -power listening and use a preamble to wake up nodes, sleep cycles when the transmitter is completely off and traffic based preamble to synchronize nodes to receive the data payload. If 1, 2, 3 are the data values of a parameter such as residual energy, observed values by the sensors, as large scale sensor deployment are a dense deployment as the reading are correlated only an average 1 needs to be transmitted. As the clustering is based on the network layer which optimizes on radio range and not the sensing region it always is approximated and corrected using some training samples using less number of bits to be transmitted, this is the fundamental design based on power -aware data model. In the MAC layer which polls the channel to check for any activity while receiving and during transmitting to avoid collision and uses best effort QoS for the messages to be forwarded. The data sen sing nodes are single hop, while forwarding nodes are multi -hop nodes. The data values which are forwarded are discrete and updated according to some trend in the data. Some measured values may be changing more quickly than others creating different traffic patterns that are data driven. The multi -hop nodes do not have any sensors and act like routers which us es best effort QoS and constantly adapts its polling depending on the data trend, this is fundamental to the design of polling the channel, which uses on -demand traffic predictions. Model implementation assumes 1, 2, 3 are always transmitted when change s happen and typically it is re -transmitted at a constant rate of 10 minute intervals keeping the channel polling of a set of nodes to guarantee the QoS. Figures 1(a,b) illustrates the Bayesian classifier for pdf based clustering and multi -hop based passiv e clustering. For the theoretical and mathematical proofs please refer to chapter 2,4 in the mentioned reference [7]. This paper builds from previous work [1,2] and extends the two dimensional Bayesian model [7] to optimize on power - aware routing alg orithms in representing sensor network. The routing algorithms are implemented at the network layer which have known density of nodes by using prior selection and at MAC layer which have unknown node densities due to limited transmission range. The Bayesian classifiers [7] which are specific to the rout ing topology uses features to maximize the lifetime of the sensor network and minimize on sensor faults. This Bayesian classifier helps in predicting the theoretical fault rate bounds by knowing the no de densities validated also through real simulation. In section II, the sensor data model is described with respect to sampling and compression needs at the cluster heads. In section III, the Source coding rate is introduced for correlated sources using error corrected codes. In section IV, the scala bility of the sensor network is modeled using Power Law and Bayseian Classifier and how it effects distributed clustering and passive clustering routing. In Section V, a distributed algorithm is simulated without MAC to find error bounds for a large -scale deployment.

This model helps in probabilistically forecasting ﬁres and help forest department in planing day to day schedules. Using a model to predict future events reliably one needs to collect samples from sensors and select a feature, which does have any particular bias. Due to practicable problems most of the collected data have 80% of attributes missing and the remaining has numeric values, which are hard to discretization. To adapt to such limitations, we use nominal data type, which allows better understanding of the temporal and spatial features, which are learnt. We encounter several practicable limitations as forest ﬁres events are very rare and manual classiﬁcation is extremely costly. Another is the unbalanced nature of the problem of the many forest ﬁre events many are of the burnt area is very small and gives skewed distribution. Most of the examples naturally group into batches, which are collected from evidence satellite photography and collaborative reports from national parks departments. The second set of database was collected from the meteorological weather station about several weather observations, which are located very close to the reported ﬁres. Finally, the compiling task is to serve as a ﬁlter and provide the user to vary the false alarm rate. We show by regression analysis of the compiled dataset that the forest ﬁre classiﬁer has a minimum false alarm rate when including temporal features. The machine learning algorithms success- fully classiﬁes accidental small ﬁres with 85% reliably and large ﬁres by a much lower accuracy of 30%.

I.INTRODUCTION Accidental small forest ﬁre can lead to heavy loss of precious natural reserves in protected lands in which many different species thrive due to their balanced ecol- ogy. Tropical rain forests are also a factor in keeping the sensitive balance global warming trends seen recently due to heavy deforestation due to human needs. Oneof objective of Datamining is to allow modeling the users’ perspective such as temporal properties, which are cause and effect of forest ﬁres, which allows in reducing false detection. The hidden patterns are mined, which allows to ﬁnd the underlying hidden structure of the data. This allows learning the concepts needed for forest ﬁres classiﬁcation. The features extracted of the predicted class by means of datamining allows to apply many machine learning algorithms to the transformed data. This framework forms the technical basis for the supervised and unsupervised classiﬁcation. Temporal query properties like weekday and week- ends help probabilistically bias the predicted outcome of class variables to be classiﬁed. As a small human accidental ﬁre or a possibility of occurrence of large natural ﬁre disasters can further be classiﬁed according to the users choice. Attribute value transformations are equally important when formulating attribute depen- dencies within a weather class [4,5,6,7] nominal values such as cool, windy and high humidity for successful formulation of machine learning rules. Following motivation the rest of the paper with is organized as follows. In Section III, we evaluate the per- formance of machine learning algorithms and develop a weak learner for temporal features. Section IV presents initial basis for user queries without signiﬁcant error analysis, that is without any ranking criteria. In Section V, we evaluate Naive Bayes [1] with Tree based classiﬁers and compare the method on the task of accidental ﬁre prediction. Section VI investigates alternative feature and computational aspects of the method respectively and explains the results. Section VII concludes the paper. II.

Most of these solutions however have aimed at industry-speciﬁc interoperability but not the siz e of the sensor network and the large amount of data which is co llected in course of its lifetime. In this paper we use well studied da ta compression algorithms which optimize on bringing down t he data redundancy which is related to correlated sensor readi ngs and using a probability model to efﬁciently compress dat a at the cluster heads. As in the case of sensor networks the data reli ability goes down as the network resource depletes and these types of networks lacks any central synchronization making it eve n more a global problem to compare different reading at the ce ntral coordinator. The complexity of calibrating each sensor and using an adaptable measured threshold to correct the readin g from sensors is a severe drain in terms of network resources and en ergy consumption. In this paper we separate the task of compa rative global analysis to a central coordinator and use a reference PMaxwhich is a normalized probability of individual source whic h reﬂects the current lifetime reliability of the sensors cal culated at the cluster heads which then is compared with the c urrent global reliability index based on all the PMaxof cluster heads. As this implementation does not need any sy nchronization at the local nodes it uses compress once and stamp locally without any thr eshold such as application speciﬁc calibration values ( 30oC) and the summarization can be application independent making it more a sensor network reliability index and using it indepen dent of the actual measured values. I. INTRODUCTION The lifetime of sensor networks is typically factored into t he resources it is deployed with, as by design it is unattende d (i.e. no replacement of batteries) it coexists for many mont hs to some years. The numbers of sensor nodes are typically ru n into hundreds to thousands in a large environmental monitor ing application. As the number of nodes in such applications are enormous than typical networks it uses a clustering algorit hms in which typically 20%-30% [5] of the nodes aggregate the data of the remaining 70%-80% [5] of the connected nodes. The se cluster heads are data concentrators which can be modeled as a device CODEC, compressor/decompressor. The sensors wh ich are attached to the nodes typically sense temperature, humidity and light. It is true, however, that the sensor meas urements in the operation region are spatially correlated ( since many environmental phenomena are) they tend to be very simil ar. In a CODEC a probability model is used which gives the highest probability to the most frequently occurred val ues reported by the sensors within the same cluster. This all ows transmitting peak values with least amount of bits as the und erlying compression algorithm assigns least number of bit f or frequently occurring values. This probability distributi on is send with the data values to the central coordinator. So each cluster head has a unique PMax[1] but not all cluster heads have the same measured value. As in recent development of VLSI and MEMS technologies have made it possible to package self-pow ered sensors and wireless radio components which together is capable of collecting and processing new sensor data for a period of many months to few years without replacing the internal batteries. The miniaturized sensors are sensitiv e to the available effective range to the energy consumed per bit. The instantaneous drain on the internal batteries is evident and the study shows thatINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON SMART SENSING AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS, VOL. 1, NO. 4, DECEMBER 2008 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON SMART SENSING AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS, VOL. 1, NO. 4, DECEMBER 2008 912",vasanth iyer garimella ram murthy m b srinivas,vasanth iyer garimella ram murthy m b srinivas

Pest management will be effective and efficient if we can predict the occurrence of peak activities of a given pest. Research efforts are going on to understand the pest dynamics by applying analytical and other techniques on pest surveillance data sets. In this study we make an effort to understand pest population dynamics using Neural Networks by analyzing pest surveillance data set of Helicoverpa armigera or Pod borer on chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) crop. The results show that neural network method successfully predicts the pest attack incidences for one week in advance. 1. Introduction Insect pests are well known as the major constraint to crop production. One of the problems in addressing pest management is inadequate knowledge about the factors influencing pest population dynamics. To understand pest dynamics, scientists collect pest surveillance data and related agricultural operations regarding crops, farming practices and other weather parameters. These databases contain details of pest incidence, climatic, soil, agricultural practices and serve as repositories of information. Correlations between some of these factors and pest incidence based on statistical models have been developed. However, a functionally viable model for pest forecast is still needed by farmers for efficient and effective pest management. Pod borer, Helicoverpa armigera is one of the key pests causing severe yield losses, infesting several crops such as cereals, pulses, cotton, vegetables and fruit crops as well as wild hosts [5]. Ecological and Physiological features like high fecundity, multi-voltinism, ability to migrate long distances and diapause during unfavorable conditions contribute for it's severity in different situations. The climatic data follows a gradual seasonal pattern that repeats almost every year. The Helicoverpa armigera incidence, on the other hand, show a certain pattern in terms of population dynamics. However the peaks can change abruptly from one week to the other. In other words the overlapping generations of the pest lead to unpredictable biological events. This non-linear and complex nature of Helicoverpa population dynamics makes it difficult to predict population densities using traditional forecasting models. In this paper, an effort has been made to understand the Helicoverpa population dynamics on the chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) crop using data mining [4] techniques such as neural networks. Literature Review: A great deal of work on forecast models has been done especially on regression modeling and simulation models. The studies conducted by Trivedi et al., (1998) [8] have proposed a multinomial regression model to predict the impending attack of Helicoverpa armigera. However the model seems to be working well only when the pest population were moderate in years like 1992-1994. Whereas when there was an unusual spurt in the pest populations during 1995 the model outputs were not up to the expectations. Pimbert and Srivastava (1991) [6] analyzed the Helicoverpa larval counts, light trap data and related parameters over six years and showed that rainfall deficit year favor Helicoverpa population in Andhra Pradesh, India. Regression analysis techniques were used by Das et al., (2001) [1] to explore the relationship between rainfall and pest abundance in different years and the cumulative effect of drought on the abundance of Helicoverpa. Kruskal-Wallis [2] one way analysis of variance by ranks was used to compare the pest abundance in normal and rainfall deficient years. In their experiment they regressed rainfall versus larval count for a period of 9 years from 1983-1989. Their results hold good for most of the period between but fail for 87/88 where there is a departure in the usual behavior of Helicoverpa from the original trend. Zhao and Shen [9] discussed about building a Monte Carlo simulation model based on variance and did not use the deviations. They used the nonlinear least square regression for simulating insect stochastic population rather than methods in Rajat Gupta IIIT, Hyderabad IndiaBVL Narayana IIIT, Hyderabad IndiaP.Krishna Reddy IIIT, Hyderabad, India E-mail:pkreddy@iiit.netG.V.Ranga Rao ICRISAT, Patancheru, India CLL Gowda ICRISAT, Patancheru, India YVR Reddy ICRISAT, Patancheru, IndiaG.Rama Murthy IIIT, Hyderabad, India Proceedings of the Third IEEE Internati onal Conference on Data Mining (ICDM’03) 0-7695-1978-4/03 $ 17.00 © 2003 IEEE",understanding helicoverpa armigera pest population dynamics,understanding helicoverpa armigera pest population dynamics

This paper proposes a new approach for securing fingerprint templates using elliptical structures generated from the fingerprint minutiae. Authors generate a feature vector from the ellipse and will be projected onto a 3D-space to compute a binary string. The resultant binary string is transformed to frequency domain (DFT) and multiplied with a user specific random matrix to make it permanently non-invertible and secure.

Introduction In the last decade, traditional systems such as tokens and passwords are most popular for personal authentication. But due to some demerits like loss of token or passwords by the user, once gained by an attacker can be used to deploy attacks [1]. To address these, biometric system has become widely popular. However if biometric trait of an individual is lost or gained by an attacker, it cannot be canceled be- cause it is limited in humans (ten fingers, one face, etc.). Hence, the protection of individual’s biometric traits is of utmost importance [1]. Ratha et al. first proposed the idea of cancellable biometrics. In cancellable biometric templates, we store the transformed templates in the database as opposed to storing the original templates. If the transformed template is compromised it does not reveal any information about the biometric data. Therefore it is significantly more secure to store transformed template into database as opposed to original ∗Corresponding author. E-mail addresses: ilaiahkavati@nitw.ac.in (I.

The current biometric template protection methods can be categorized as follows: Biometric cryptosystems: This system combine cryptog- raphy and biometrics to benefit from the strengths of both fields [3,4]. The data stored is independent to original tem- plates and does not reveal any information about the original biometric template. Watermarking approaches: When the traits of one bio- metric is embedded into the other biometric traits, then this approach is called watermarking [5,6]. This approach is hard to forge by the attacker as the watermarking information should be known by the attacker. Cancellable template approaches: In this approach, the biometric features extracted are mapped to a predefined multi- dimensional matrix maps the feature vector [7–10]. By travers- ing the matrix a binary string is generated and is then transformed. This method is more secure compared to the methods discussed above. 2.

Introduction Diabetes is a metabolic disease which causes due to deﬁciency of insulin hormone in human body. There are mainly two types of Diabetes namely type-1 and type-2. In type-1 Diabetes the body’s immune system destroys the cells (β- cells) that release insulin, eventually it eliminates insulin production from the body. Insulin is a harmone that helpsto cells in absorbing glucose, which they need to produce energy. Eventually body becomes insulin dependent. In type-2 diabetes, the body isn’t able to use insulin in the right way. This situation is called insulin resistance. As type-2 Diabetes gets worse, the pancreas may produce less and less insulin. This is called insulin deﬁciency [1]. Type-2Diabetes accounts for the vast majority share in Diabetes eﬀected people (95 out of 100 people) [2]. Without insulin or insuﬃcient insulin leads to excess sugar levels in the blood. As a result, it impacts lot of organs in the body such as heart, kidney, limp, eye etc. In the long run this situation leads to a various complications like cardiovascular damage, kidney damage, nerve damage, eye damage and stroke etc. [3, 4]. Hence, it is necessary to use more robust classiﬁer which helps the doctors for better diagnosis of diabetes in early stages. ∗Corresponding author. Tel.: +91-957-382-7143.

Abstract: Diabetes is a chronic disease caused by insulin deficiency, and it should be detected in the early stages for effective treatment. In this paper, the Diabetes-Network (Dia-Net) is proposed to increase diabetes predictive accuracy. The proposed Dia-Net is a dual-stage network. It combines both optimized probabilistic neural network (OPNN) and optimized radial basis function neural network (ORBFNN) in the first stage. Hence, Dia-Net possesses the advantages of both the models. In the second stage, the linear support vector machine is used. As the dataset size increases, both RBFNN and PNN perform better, but both suffers from complexity and computational problems. To address these problems, in this paper, particle swarm optimiza-tion-based clustering is employed for discovering centers in high-dense regions. This reduces the size of the hidden layer of both RBFNN and PNNs. Experiments are carried out on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. The Experimental results showed that the proposed Dia-Net model outperformed individual as well as state-of-the-art models.

Its prevalence is rising every year. Diabetes occurs when the body fails to produce insulin or produce insufficient insulin hormone. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that helps to regulate glucose levels in the blood. The most common form of diabetes is type-2 diabetes; in this, pancreas loses the ability to appropriately produce and release insulin. Uncontrolled diabetes causes rise in blood sugar levels, this increases the risks of developing dis - eases like kidney failure, heart attack, blindness, nerve damage, and blood vessel damage. About half of the patients with type-2 diabetes are undiagnosed. The detection of diabetes disease in earlier stages improves the patient’s life span. Thus, classification algorithms play a vital role in the prediction of diabetes [2, 25]. The multi-layer feed forward neural networks (MLFFNNs) and the multi-layer perceptron neural networks (MLPNNs) are the most popular techniques for classification and use iterative process for training. Contrary to the MLFFNNs and MLPNNs, the radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) and the probabilistic neural networks (PNNs) are trained in single iteration and learn applications quickly. Thus, the RBFNNs and PNNs draw the researcher’s attention for classification tasks. Moreover, the performances of these neural networks are on par with the MLFFNNs and MLPNNs [1, 26]. Although the existing rule-based and non rule-based classification algorithms are popular, they show moderate performance. Hence, an ensemble technique gained attention, which performs better than the *Corresponding author: Ramalingaswamy Cheruku, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of Technology Goa, Ponda 403401, Goa, India, e-mail: rmlswamygoud@nitgoa.ac.in, rmlswamygoud@gmail.com; and Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Mahindra École Centrale College of Engineering, Bahadurpally, Hyderabad-500034, Telangana, India. https:/ /orcid.org/0000-0003-1677-5321 Damodar Reddy Edla: Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of Technology Goa, Ponda 403401, Goa, India Open Access. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

However, in realistic environment, it can be observed that there may be some defective items in an ordered lot, because of these defective items retailer may incurs additional cost due to rejection, repair and refund etc. Thus, inspection/screening of lot becomes essential in most of the organizations. Shortages may occur due to defective items, which can be prevented by placing an order at the time when the inventory level is good enough to meet the demand during the screening process. Further, it is generally assumed that payment will be made to the supplier for the goods immediately after receiving the consignment. Whereas, in practice, supplier does offers a certain fixed period to the retailer for settling the account. During this period, supplier charges no interest, but beyond this period interest is being charged as has been agreed upon. On the other hand, retailer can earn interest on the revenue generated during this period. Keeping this scenario in mind, an attempt has been made to formulate an inventory model for imperfect quality items under the condition of permissible delay in payments. Results have been validated with the help of a numerical example. Comprehensive sensitivity analysis has also been presented. Index Terms —Inventory, imperfect items, permissible delay, overlapping. I. INTRODUCTION In today‟s technology driven world, despite of efficient planning of manufacturing system and emergence of sophisticated production methods and control systems; the items produced may have some fraction of defectives. By considering this fact, researchers devoted a great amount of effort to develop EPQ/EOQ models for defective items (Porteus [1], Rosenblatt and Lee [2], Lee and Rosenblatt [3], Schwaller [4], Zhang and Gerchak [5]). In 2000 , Salameh and Jaber [6] extended the traditional EPQ/EOQ model for the imperfect quality items. They also considered that the imperfect - quality items are sold at a discounted price as a single batch by the end of the screening process. Cá rdenas- Barró n [7] corrected the optimum order size formula obtained by Salameh and Jaber [6] by adding constant parameter which was missing in their optimum order size formula. Further, Goyal and Cá rdenas-Barró n [8] presented a simple approach for determining economic production Manuscript received August 9, 2013; revised October 13, 2013. Chandra K.

Papachristos and Konstantaras [9] examined the Salameh and Jaber [6] paper closely and rectify the proposed conditions to ensure that shortages will not occur. They extended their model to the case in which withdrawing takes place at the end of the planning horizon. Further, Wee et al ., [10] extended the model of Salameh and Jaber [6] for the case where shortages are back ordered in each cycle. Maddah and Jaber [11] corrected Salameh and Jaber [6] work related to the method of evaluating the expected total profit per unit time and applied renewal-reward theorem (Ross [12]). Further, Eroglu and Ozdemir [13] also extended the model of Salameh and Jaber [6] by allowing shortages to be backordered. They suggest that a fraction of good quality items in each cycle not only fulfills current demand but also fulfills backorders during screening process. In all the above mentioned papers, it is tacitly assumed that payment will be made to the supplier for the goods immediately after receiving the consignment. However, in day-to-day dealing, it is found that the supplier allows a certain fixed period to settle the account. During this period, no interest is charged by the supplier, but beyond this period interest is charged under certain terms and conditions agreed upon, since inventories are usually financed through debt or equity. Owing to this fact, during the past few years, a lot of research work has been done on inventory models with permissible delay in payments, which has been summarized by Soni et al., [14]. Further, Chung and Huang [15] incorporated the concept of inspection of imperfect items with trade credit. Jaggi et al., [16] formulated an inventory model with imperfect quality deteriorating items with the assumption that the screening rate is more than the demand rate. This assumption helps one to meet his demand parallel to the screening process, out of the items which are of perfect quality. Recently, Maddah et al ., [17] introduced the concept of order overlapping to prevent shortages. They represent an improvement in customer service level over earlier literature, when demand is assumed to be met during the screening period from the order being screened leading to potential shortages. In this paper, an inventory model is developed for imperfect quality items under permissible delay in payments. The screening rate is assumed to be more than the demand rate. This assumption helps one to meet his demand during the screening process, out of the items which are of perfect quality. Further, to prevent shortages an order is placed during the screening process at the time when inventory level is good enough to meet demand.

Abstract To ensure the secure transmission of data, cryptography is treated as the most e ective solution. Cryptographic key is an important entity in this procedure. In general, randomly generated cryptographic key (of 256 bits) is dicult to remember. However, such a key needs to be stored in a protected place or transported through a shared communication line which, in fact, poses another threat to security. As an alternative, researchers advocate the generation of cryptographic key using the biometric traits of both sender and receiver during the sessions of communication, thus avoiding key storing and at the same time without compromising the strength in security. Nevertheless, the biometric- based cryptographic key generation possesses few concerns such as privacy of biometrics, sharing of biometric data between both communicating users (i.e., sender and receiver), and generating revocable key from irrevocable biometric. This work addresses the above-mentioned concerns. In this work, a framework for secure communication between two users using ngerprint based crypto-biometric system has been proposed. For this, Die- Hellman (DH) algorithm is used to generate public keys from private keys of both sender and receiver which are shared and further used to produce a sym- metric cryptographic key at both ends. In this approach, revocable key for symmetric cryptography is generated from irrevocable ngerprint.

ABSTRACT In a biometric veriﬁcation system, leakage of biometric data leads to permanent identity loss since original biometric data is inherently linked to a user. Further, various types of attacks on a biometric system may reveal the original template and utility in other applications. To address these security and privacy concerns cancelable biometric has been introduced. Cancelable biometric constructs a protected template from the original biometric template using transformation functions and performs the comparison between templates in the transformed domain. Recent approaches towards cancelable ﬁngerprint generation either rely on aligning minutiae points with respect to singular points (core/delta) or utilize the absolute coordinate positions of minutiae points. In this paper, we propose a novel non- invertible ridge feature transformation method to protect the original ﬁngerprint template information. The proposed method partitions the ﬁngerprint region into a number of sectors with reference to each minutia point employing a ridge-based co-ordinate system. The nearest neighbor minutiae in each sector are identiﬁed, and ridge-based features are computed. Further, a cancelable template is generated by applying the Cantor pairing function followed by random projection. We have evaluated our method with FVC2002, FVC2004 and FVC2006 databases. It is evident from the experimental results that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in the literature. Moreover, the security analysis demonstrates that the proposed method fulﬁlls the necessary requirements of non-invertibility, revocability, and diversity with a minor performance degradation caused due to cancelable transformation. INDEX TERMS biometric, cancelable biometrics, ﬁngerprint, minutiae, alignment-free, feature extrac- tion, privacy, security I. INTRODUCTION THE compromise of stored biometric template causes permanent identity theft of a user as biometric data is irreplaceable and irrevocable. There are various types of attacks and privacy concerns linked with sharing of biometric information across multiple applications [1], [2]. Jain et al. [3] identiﬁed four levels of attacks in a biometric system. At the ﬁrst level, the attacker presents a falsiﬁed biometric input to the sensor, and the sensor may not be able to differentiate between genuine and fake biometric inputs. Second, the attacker intercepts the communication link between the different modules to enter into the system.At the third level, the attacker intercepts the executable program of a module to get the desired output. Such attacks are called Trojan-Horse attacks. Last, the attacker replaces/ derives a spoof of the stored template which causes the security breach. Therefore, biometric template protection is necessary to address such security challenges. To provide biometric template protection against the afore-mentioned attacks, an idea of cancelable biometrics has been presented. The cancelable biometric scheme applies a transformation to derive a protected template which is used for veriﬁcation instead of the original template of a user. The transformation relies on a non-invertible function such that it is hard to VOLUME 4, 2016 1arXiv:1805.10853v1 [cs.CV] 28 May 2018",date of publication xxxx 00 0000 date of current version xxxx 00 0000,date of publication xxxx 00 0000 date of current version xxxx 00 0000

To address these issues, we propose a hybrid fusion framework where only the protected modalities are combined to fulﬁll the requirement of secrecy and performance improvement. This paper presents a method to integrate cance- lable modalities utilizing mean-closure weighting (MCW) score level and Dempster- Shafer (DS) theory based decision level fusion for iris and ﬁngerprint to mitigate the limitations in the individual score or decision fusion mechanisms. The proposed hybrid fusion scheme incorporates the similarity scores from different matchers cor- responding to each protected modality. The individual scores obtained from different matchers for each modality are combined using MCW score fusion method. The MCW technique achieves the optimal weight for each matcher involved in the score computation. Further, DS theory is applied to the induced scores to output the ﬁnal decision. The rigorous experimental evaluations on three virtual databases indicate that the proposed hybrid fusion framework outperforms over the component level or individual fusion methods (score level and decision level fusion). As a result, we achieve (48%,66%), (72%,86%) and (49%,38%) of performance improvement over unimodal cancelable iris and unimodal cancelable ﬁngerprint veriﬁcation systems for Virtual A, Virtual B and Virtual C databases, respectively. Also, the proposed method is robust enough to the variability of scores and outliers satisfying the re- quirement of secure authentication.

However, security theft and privacy invasion are two passive issues that still persist in the effective deployment of biometric-based authentication systems. Com- promise of biometric data can potentially lead to serious security violation as the user’s biometric trait cannot be changed. In order to prevent the invasion of biometric templates, it is desired to morph the original biometric template through non-invertible or irrevers- ible transformation function. This transformed template is referred to as cancelable template and can be replaced or reissued in case of compromise. In this paper, we propose a novel cancelable iris template generation technique based on randomized look-up table mapping. The technique utilizes a decimal vector generated from a rotation-invariant feature vector. The feature vector is generated using 1-D Log Gabor ﬁlter applied to the iris image. Experi- ments carried out on various iris databases conﬁrm the efﬁcacy of the proposed approach. After applying the template protection mechanism, we have achieved Equal Error Rate (EER) of 0.37%, 0.43% and 0.79% for CASIA-V 1.0, CASIA-V3-Interval and ICE 2005 iris databases, respectively. Moreover, the transformation preserves the irreversibility, revocability and di- versity properties of the concealable iris templates. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction Over the last decade, biometric authentication has gained much public attention as compared to traditional knowledge (pass- word, key) or token-based authentication systems and is widely deployed to identify/verify users ﬁrmly in several domains. However, biometric-based authentication systems suffer from security and privacy invasion challenges as their compro- mise may expose sensitive and ancillary information about a user. Further, if the biometric template gets compromised, it results in permanent identity theft as biometric data are in- trinsically linked to the user. This introduces the researchquestion “how do we replace the biometric data which is per- manent and limited for a user without affecting the accuracy of the system?”. The different attacks such as hill-climbing, cor- relation or stolen-token attacks ( Jain et al., 2008 ) can be launched for illicit use of biometric data which reduce the reliability of the system. In correlation attack, the attacker intercepts mul- tiple protected templates of the same user from different applications and tries to ﬁnd out the correlation between these protected templates to retrieve the original template ( Rathgeb and Uhl, 2011 ). The hill-climbing attack is launched to maxi- mize the matching score by iteratively and incrementally modifying the biometric input ( Rathgeb and Uhl, 2011 ).

The database is the single most useful setting for caching data, and it is also an ideal tool for contriving, managing, updating, and modifying data from dif ferent angles. The benefits of a well -structured blood bank database are limitless and yield the benefits of improv ing efficiency and saving time. Here, our motive is centred on this area. India faces a shortage when it comes to the amount of blood donated. The gap in demand and supply in widened due to mismanagement and inefficient databases. We have modelled a well -organized database to try and reduce this gap. Alongside, we have developed an application that reminds donors when they become eligible again, giv es locations of nearby blood donation camps, makes requesting blood easier for blood recipients etc. as well a s promoting a healthy community. IOT is used for interlinking the application to the server as well as for inter -application communication . With the help of IOT this collection and exchange of data becomes more efficient. © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The 2nd International Workshop on Internet of Things : Scope and Opportunities (IoT -S&O) November 1 -4, 2021, Leuven, Belgium Blood Bank Management and Inventory Control Database Management System Aman Shah*, Dev Shah, Devanshi Shah, Daksh Chordiya, Nishant Doshi, Rudresh Dwivedi Computer Science Engineering, Pandit Deendayal Energy University, Gandhinagar 382355, India Abstract This paper presents a detailed approach for an efficient blood bank database management system. The database is the single most useful setting for caching data, and it is also an ideal tool for contriving, managing, updating, and modifying data from dif ferent angles. The benefits of a well -structured blood bank database are limitless and yield the benefits of improv ing efficiency and saving time. Here, our motive is centred on this area. India faces a shortage when it comes to the amount of blood donated. The gap in demand and supply in widened due to mismanagement and inefficient databases. We have modelled a well -organized database to try and reduce this gap. Alongside, we have developed an application that reminds donors when they become eligible again, giv es locations of nearby blood donation camps, makes requesting blood easier for blood recipients etc. as well a s promoting a healthy community. IOT is used for interlinking the application to the server as well as for inter -application communication . With the help of IOT this collection and exchange of data becomes more efficient. © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Despite such growth, we face a shortage of nearly 1.95 million units. We aim to create an efficient database system to curb the existing gaps in the Blood banking systems and ensure minimal wastage of blood units.

Author/ Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000 –000 database using Microsoft SQL server. Blunders at the hour of organization of blood or blood parts have resulted in severe casualties. We have created a system that mitigates suc h disparities[1]. Rajya Sabha was informed by the Union government of India that 63 districts did not have blood banks. Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Bihar, Meghalaya and Nagaland are the states that face such issues. 2. Literature Survey Recently, various approaches for blood bank database systems have been proposed in the literature. Few of the relevant methods are described here: 2.1. The Optimization of Blood Donor Information and Management System by Technopedia Priya et al. [3] int roduced an android mobile application with GIS that establishes a productive, organized, and secure Information Management System. The proposed solution detects fake donors and the misuse of information by users of the application. Also, quality checking o f blood at various levels is introduced. It is required for the safety of the patients. 2.2 A Study on Blood Bank Management System Teena et al. [4] designed an efficient information management system that maintains records of donors and patients. It has a security layer that allows only authorized employees of the Blood bank to access and update the records through a login using a secret password. 2.3. Effective Blood Bank Management Based On RFID in Real Time Systems Pramodini et al. [7] have created a databa se system which minimizes human error. Most of these errors occur during a blood transfusion. They have ensued a Blood bank DBMS based on RFID that strives at mitigating these errors.. 3. Proposed Approach The proposed system endeavours to help blood bank su pervisors to service inquiries and various blood recipients, whether they are individual patrons or hospitals, with higher efficacy and attenuate wastage. This approach tries to effectively bridge the gap between blood banks, donors and recipients by creat ing effective databases and applications for all the three and further breaking down the databases to reduce the chances of the inconsistency of the data and hence increasing the efficiency of the system.",procedia computer science 198 (2022) 404 409,procedia computer science 198 (2022) 404 409

Compromise of biometric data may cause permanent loss of identity since the biometric information is intrinsically linked with t he user.

There are several privacy issues associated with the sharing of biometric information across many applications [ 1]. Therefore, it is necessary to provide biometric template protection. The concept of cancelable biometric h as been introduced for template protection which state that a transformed te mplate is required to be stored instead of the original biometric template.

The objective of an online Mart is to match buyers and sellers, to weigh animals and to oversee their sale. A reliable pricing method can be developed by ML models that can read through historical sales data. However, when AI models suggest or recommend a price, that in itself does not reveal too much (i.e., it acts like a black box) about the qualities and the abilities of an animal. An interested buyer would like to know more about the salient features of an animal before making the right choice based on his requirements. A model capable of explaining the di erent factors that impact the price point is essential for the needs of the market. It can also inspire con dence in buyers and sellers about the price point o ered. To achieve these objectives, we have been working with the team at MartEye, a startup based in Portershed in Galway City, Ireland.

Proposed technique is robust to occlusion, specular re°ection, variation in illumination and non-centered gaze. For pupil localisation, the input iris image is binarised using an adaptive threshold deter- mined based on number of connected components. Further, pupil center and radius are obtained using spectrum image based approach. The proposed technique performs accu- rately ( >97%) with low computation ( <0.4 seconds/image). It has been observed that the proposed approach can be de- ployed to real-time biometric systems where time as well as accuracy cannot be compromised.

Figure 1: Binarization using adaptive threshold [2] localisation of inner pupil and outer iris boundary that are presumed to be concentric circular. Localised iris is used for feature extraction and matching. As localisation is the primitive operation, any failure compromises performance of the subsequent process. There are several issues to be handled for sengmenting iris. Firstly, static threshold fails to binarize iris image for varying illumination. Secondly, iris occlusion by eyelids and eyelashes degrades the performance of localisation module. Thirdly, during image acquisition the spot of light creates specular highlights on pupil which adds noise to input and hinder localisation. Lastly, the gaze of an individual may not be centered. Such images are usually acquired in non- cooperative environment. The minimum value of mean in- tensity of a grid in iris image ihas been taken as threshold for binarizing the pupil [2] as shown in Figure 1, but it fails due to specular highlights. In the proposed paper, a robust iris segmentation approach has been developed that performs well for aforementioned issues. The detailed description of steps involved are given in Section 2. For accurate pupil detection, an adaptive threshold is obtained from input iris image as given in Section 2.1. The hole ¯lled binary image is used for ¯nding pupil boundary using spectrum image (Sec- tion 2.2). Section 2.3 outlines the approach to ¯nd outer iris boundary. Experimental results for the proposed approach are given in Section 3. 2. PROPOSED IRIS SEGMENTATION Iris segmentation comprises ¯nding the inner pupil and outer iris boundary. The annular region lying between the two boundaries is considered for feature extraction. In this paper an e±cient and fast iris segmentation approach is pro- posed. This approach takes an input iris image and ¯nds an adaptive threshold for pupil detection. The pupil boundary is obtained using spectrum image based approach. Finally iris boundary is found using traditional homocentric circular summation of intensities.

Recent leading approaches for unsupervised domain adaptation are based on adversarial alignment. Aligning the global distribution of the domain repre- sentations via adversarial training does not guarantee the class- wise distribution alignment. The proposed approach is built on adversarial learning with the focus on carefully aligning class-wise domain representations. Our algorithm utilizes the pseudo-labels (the predicted labels) of the target features to stimulate class-wise alignment. As the pseudo-labels of individual target features can be erroneous, instead of iteratively aligning individual target samples, the proposed framework introduces a generic class-speciﬁc multi-partition alignment procedure that enables superior class-discriminative alignment of domain repre- sentations. The competitive performance of the proposed frame- work against state-of-the-art approaches over a wide variety of visual recognition tasks, namely, the digits classiﬁcation task and the object recognition task, validates its effectiveness for unsupervised domain adaptation. I. I NTRODUCTION With deep neural networks, the key to success for supervised visual recognition tasks is the availability of plentiful labeled examples. Often, for many real-world problems, the quantity of available labeled data is scarce. Even if unlabeled data is available, manually labeling the training data demands domain expertise and is a laborious task. Leveraging labeled samples from existing auxiliary domains (often termed as the source domains) can help to learn the desired task for the domain of interest (often referred to as the target domain). However, when the well-trained source model is evaluated on target examples, the performance suffers due to the distribution differences between the domains. The performance of a well- trained classiﬁer in a new domain depends on two factors [1], 1) the performance in its domain and 2) the discrepancy be- tween the two domains. The discrepancy between the domains, popularly known as domain shift or dataset shift, calls for domain adaptation. In this paper, we propose a deep adaptation framework that learns an efﬁcient deep neural model for the target domain where no labeled data is available. This setting is commonly known as Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). A common theme among recent promising deep UDA approaches is the use of adversarial training to align the feature distributions of the source and target domain. Based on theGenerative Adversarial Network (GAN) loss, the adversarial adaptation procedure trains two competing networks - a feature generator network (one network each for the source and the target domain) and a domain classiﬁer network. Here, the domain classiﬁer (also known as the discriminator network) distinguishes the representations of the source and the target domain. In general, the source feature generator learns the class-discriminative features from the source labeled data whereas the target feature generator network is adversarially trained to confuse the domain classiﬁer by generating source- like representations from the target samples. Learning domain invariant features with unsupervised adversarial adaptation only aligns the marginals distributions of the domains [21] and does not guarantee the class-speciﬁc alignment of the domain representations. Matching the class-wise distribution involves bringing the similarly labeled source and target representations closer to each other. As the target labels are not available in the unsupervised setting, some of the recent deep UDA approaches [15], [18], [26], [24], [3] utilize the pseudo-labels (the pre- dicted labels for the target samples) as the categorical informa- tion for the target domain. However, the predicted labels are not guaranteed to be correct (even if conﬁdently predicted). Consequently, progressive class-wise alignment of individual pseudo-labeled target samples leads to error accumulation and thereby, limits the transfer performance. Therefore, instead of aligning individual target samples, two recent approaches [24], [3] align the class-wise mean of the source and the target domain representations. Aligning the means limits the effect of noise as it alleviates the bias from incorrect pseudo-labeled target samples and has shown signiﬁcant improvement over the adversarial adaptation baseline. One explicit shortcoming with these approaches is that during the class-wise alignment of representations, there may exist several partitions for every label in the feature space that are distant from each other. Hence, only aligning the individual class-wise means would be ill-suited to match the conditional distribution of the domains. Figure 1 depicts a visual comparison of the learned representations with class- wise mean-alignment [24], [3] approaches versus the proposed approach. Consider a simple scenario, where for the red class (refer Figure 1 (d)), there are two distant compact partitions of the source representations and one dense partition formed by the target representations. Here, bringing the target mean closer to the source mean will lack in the good congruence 978-1-7281-6926-2/20/$31.00 ©2020 IEEE",sanatan sukhija z srenivas varadarajany narayanan c krishnan x sujit rai,sanatan sukhija z srenivas varadarajany narayanan c krishnan x sujit rai

Transfer learning algorithms utilize knowledge from a data-rich source domain to learn a model in the target domain where labeled data is scarce. This paper presents a novel solution for the challenging and interesting problem of Heterogeneous Transfer Learning (HTL) where the source and target task have heterogeneous feature and label spaces. Contrary to common space based HTL al- gorithms, the proposed HTL algorithm adapts source data for the target task. The correspondence required for aligning the heterogeneous features of the source and target domain is obtained through labels across two domains that are semantically aligned using web-induced knowledge. The experimental results suggest that the proposed algorithm performs signiﬁcantly better than state-of-the-art transfer ap- proaches on three diverse real-world transfer tasks. Keywords: Heterogeneous Transfer Learning Sample Selection 1 Introduction Traditional supervised algorithms require sufﬁcient labeled data to learn a computa- tional model with a reasonable generalization to unseen examples. However, for many real-world problems, collecting labeled data is often very expensive and cumbersome. Transfer learning approaches utilize knowledge from an auxiliary domain with abun- dant labeled data (source domain) to perform tasks in domains with scarce labeled data (target domain). HTL [37] algorithms transfer knowledge from one domain to the other when the two domains have different features. Due to the heterogeneous feature spaces, the ﬁrst task of any HTL algorithm is to decide a “common” space for adaptation. The second task is to bridge the gap between the data differences that arise when the data from both the domains is projected onto the common space. This is generally achieved by leveraging some pivotal information that is shared among the domains. These pivots could be in the form of instance correspondences [39], overlapping features [20], shared label space [29, 40, 28], common meta-features/latent space [38, 14, 12, 11] or any task speciﬁc/independent information [21, 41]. Latent Space Transformation (LST) approaches to HTL project the data from both the domains onto a shared subspace for adaptation, thus learning two transformations, one each for the source and target domain. On the other hand, Feature Space Remap- ping (FSR) approaches consider the common space as either of the two domains and determine a single transformation to transform data from the source domain to the target domain or vice-versa. The recent state-of-the-art HTL approaches leverage the common",web-induced heterogeneous transfer learning with,web-induced heterogeneous transfer learning with

As the information being searched over the internet is rapidly increasing, users often face the diculty of nding items of his/her own interest and RS often provides help in such tasks. Recent studies show that, as the item space increases, and the number of items rated by the users become very less, issues like sparsity arise. To mitigate the sparsity problem, transfer learning techniques are being used wherein the data from dense domain(source) is considered in order to predict the missing entries in the sparse domain(target). In this paper, we propose a transfer learning approach for cross-domain recommendation when both domains have no overlap of users and items. In our approach the transferring of knowledge from source to target domain is done in a novel way. We make use of co-clustering technique to obtain the codebook (cluster-level rating pattern) of source domain. By making use of hinge loss function we transfer the learnt codebook of the source domain to target. The use of hinge loss as a loss function is novel and has not been tried before in transfer learning. We demonstrate that our technique improves the approximation of the target matrix on benchmark datasets. Keywords Matrix Factorisation Collaborative Filtering CodebookTransfer Learning Cross-Domain Recommendation 1 Introduction Recent years have witnessed a clear explosion in the amount of e-commerce data available. As a result, the quantity of information that needs to be searched for suggesting items of interest to users is becoming more challenging. Recommender systems (1)(2)(21) can be used for predicting items that the users will be interested in and has become a core part of several e-commerce applications. Machine learning techniques (19) have become an integral part in the process of building recommender systems and in the last decade or so there has been a surge in this area of research. In general, the existing algorithms for recommender systems can be broadly categorized into three major categories namely content-based (CB), collaborative (CF) and hybrid recommendation. In content-based method, the recommendation is made by rst calculating a similarity score between a user pro le and the pro le information of an item. Based on the similarity score, a set of top kitems are then recommended to a user. For instance, in movie recommendation task, the pro le information of a user contains his/her interest over the genre . A movie is then can be recommended by nding out the similarity between the user interest for the genre and the movie description (genre). In the case of collaborative ltering, the preferences of the target user are matched with that of other users having similar tastes and a recommendation is made.

Data Sparsity is one of the major drawbacks with collaborative ltering technique arising due to the less number of transactions and feedback data. In order to reduce the sparsity problem, techniques called transfer learning/cross-domain recommendation has emerged. In transfer learning methods, the data from other dense domain(s) (source) is considered in order to predict the missing ratings in the sparse domain (target). In this paper, we come up with a novel transfer learning approach for cross-domain recommendation, wherein the cluster-level rating pattern(codebook) of the source domain is obtained via a co-clustering technique. Thereafter we apply the Maximum Margin Matrix factorization(MMMF) technique on the codebook in order to learn the user and item latent features of codebook. Prediction of the target rating matrix is achieved by introducing these latent features in a novel way into the optimisation function. In the experiments we demonstrate that our model improves the prediction accuracy of the target matrix on benchmark datasets. Keywords Collaborative Filtering Matrix Factorisation CodebookTransfer Learning Cross-Domain Recommendation 1 Introduction The key idea of a recommender system (RS) Bobadilla et al. (2013); Ricci et al. (2010); Aggarwal (2016) is to provide useful information to users regarding the products/items that would be interested in. Collaborative ltering (CF) is one of the common techniques used in recommendation engines to learn user pro les so that preferred items can be recommended. In CF, a recommendation is made for a user (usually called the target user) by taking into consideration the known preferences of other users who are much alike to the target user. Matrix factorization Koren et al. (2009); Wu (2007) is widely considered as one of the most promising collaborative ltering techniques. MF nds the user and item latent features from a given user-item rating matrix, and the product of these latent feature vectors yields the approximation/prediction of the rating matrix. Let us suppose that we are given X2Rm1n1which is a user-item rating matrix. The number of users is denoted by m1andn1denotes the items.

INTRODUCTION There are wide varieties of storage systems, for instance, compressed air energy storage, electrochemical battery energy storage systems (BESSs), pumped storage hydroelectric systems, hydrogen storage, ﬂywheel energy storage, thermal energy storage, supercapacitors, cryogenic energy storage, liquid metal batteries, pumped thermal electricity storage and superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) systems. Each storage system is associated with pros and cons. BESS is considered very less because of its voltage and current limitations. Further, the chemicals were used in the manufacturing of batteries, which adversely affect the environment. Also, pumped storage hydroelectric systems depend up on its geographical locations. Hence, it may not be suitable for applications that used in day-to-day life. By overcoming all these limitations, SMES has a capability to store electric energy. The versatile and potential applications of SMES can be found in electrical energy and power systems. The principle of operation of an SMES is when a direct current (DC) voltage is applied across the terminals of a coil, energy will be stored. The current in the coil will continue to ﬂow even after voltage source has beenremoved. This is because when a superconductor is cooled less than its critical temperature, the coil attains a very less resistance that is negligible, due to which energy will be stored by generated magnetic ﬁeld due to its inherent current. The energy can be discharged by its discharging coil. SMES can transit from its full-charge state to full discharge state at high speed vice versa, due to which the efﬁciency of SMES are very high compared with normal coils. Generally, SMES has very quick self-discharge because of its self-cooling via cryogenic liquid. The general components of SMES are shown in Figure 1. It mainly consists of three parts: (i) low- temperature/high-temperature superconducting coil magnet, (ii) cryogenic refrigerator and (iii) helium/nitrogen liquid. This article is mainly focussed on the application of SMES in electrical power and energy systems. This article is composed with ﬁve sections. First section gives a brief introduction about SMES. Second section deals with various applications of SMES in microgrid (MG). Further section deals with application of SMES in electrical vehicle (EV) systems.

This type of application is particularly suited for rural areas that have a considerable amount of solar radiation and have no access to grid systems. The proposed system is comprised of a photovoltaic (PV) array, DC-DC boost converter and DC-DC buck converter. Two Permanent Magnet Brushless Direct Current (PMBLDC) motors are employed to drive a centrifugal water pump and an air blower coupled to their individual shafts. The air blower is connected with a DC- DC boost converter that ensures a maximum power point (MPP) operation. A centrifugal water pump is connected with a DC-DC buck converter. The challenging task in an air cooling system is to maintain the constant speed of the blower under variable irradiance conditions. The power provided by the solar PV array can be shared between the two DC-DC converters in such a way that the BLDC motor connected with the blower will maintain a constant speed by maintaining the constant voltage of the DC- DC boost converter. The rest of the available PV power will be handled by the pump. The suitability of the proposed system for various perturbations is evaluated by simulating the proposed system using a MATLAB/Simulink and is validated by conducting experiments. Case studies have been performed with a variable PV irradiance and the results are explored. Index Terms —BLDC air blower, BLDC motor, BLDC Pump, PV System. I. I NTRODUCTION THE rate of energy consumption is increasing very rapidly due to increases in population, industrialization, trans- portation, etc. and the energy supply is depleting due to the annihilation of fossil fuels, resulting in inﬂation and energy shortages.

DOI: 10.17775/CSEEJPES.2018.00410Panels in recent years along with their increased lifetime [2] has increased the usage of solar photovoltaic (PV) based generation for various household and industrial applications. Although several researches have been carried out on PV array fed automotive and irrigation systems combining various DC-DC converters and motor drives [3]–[6], very little work has been done on PV based home appliances. Further, the applications of BLDC motors are expanding, as these motors are highly reliable, highly efﬁcient, with low radio frequency interference, noise and high torque/inertia ratio with improved cooling, and require practically no maintenance [5], [6]. Due to these merits, a BLDC motor is considered to help develop a solar PV fed air cooler, which can operate satisfactorily for longer time periods as compared to brushed motors under dynamically changing atmospheric conditions. The Perturb & Observe (P&O) based maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm [7] is used to control the DC-DC converter such that the solar PV system always operates at its MPP. The challenging issue in designing a solar air cooler as compared to solar pumps [4]–[6] is to maintain the constant speed of the motor that drives the air blower. In the process of maintaining the constant speed of the air blower, power imbalance occurs between the PV source and the load which otherwise leads to a continuous rise or fall in the DC capacitor voltage. To avoid this power imbalance and to manage DC voltage within limits, an additional BLDC motor is used which can be used to drive the pump load in the cooler. Two three-phase voltage source inverters (VSI) are used to feed the BLDC motors driving the cooler mechanical loads. The inverters are operated at fundamental frequencies which are obtained from the motor running speed which reduces the switching losses in the inverter [6]. A hall sensor-based scheme is adopted to obtain the speed and position of the BLDC motor [8]. The electronic commutator provides the gate pulses to the inverter circuit and hence controls the pattern of the stator currents of the BLDC motor. An inner hysteresis current controller based speed controller scheme is adopted which controls the motor speed control and also limits the current ﬂowing through the inverter and the BLDC motor which is used to drive the air blower. Further, an optimal power extraction from the SPV system is given in [12]–[14]. This paper is organized as follows: Section II describes the conﬁguration of the solar air cooler system. The designing procedure for individual components of the solar air cooler is illustrated in Section III. Section IV explains the control schematic used for both the BLDC motors along with the DC 2096-0042 © 2018 CSEE",csee journal of power and energy systems vol 5 no 1 march 2019 111,csee journal of power and energy systems vol 5 no 1 march 2019 111

The role of test automation in Agile Software Development projects is of paramount importance. It is absolutely necessary to automate tests on agileprojects as the number of test cases will continue to grow with each successive sprint. Through a Grounded Theory study involving 38 agile practitioners from 18 diﬀerent software organizations in India, we identiﬁed ﬁve key challengesfaced by agile practitioners and diﬀerent strategies to overcome those challenges while practicing test automation. Understanding these challenges and strategies would help agile teams in streamlining their test automation practices. Keywords: Test automation · Test driven development · Agile software development · Grounded theory 1 Introduction The widespread use and popularity of agile methodologies are primarily due to their ability to produce quality software in less time with limited manpower. Most of the software industries are using scrum and XP methodologies of agile software develop‐ ment. Testing is an integral part of development in agile projects rather than a distinct Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) phase [ 1]. Software test automation refers to the activities and eﬀorts that intend to automate engineering tasks in a software test proces s using well-deﬁned strategies and systematic solution [ 2]. According to [ 3] test automation is one of the most eﬀective solution for projects which have strict deadlines as it speeds up the test execution and increases the test coverage. Automation on a scrum project is not optional, for a team to sprint eﬀectively and deliver value quickly, it needs to rely heavily on test automation [ 4]. Crispin and Gregory [5] argued that test automation is the key f actor for successful agile software develop‐ ment and the core of agile testing. In a study by Puleio’s [ 6] test automation was seen as a key factor in agile testing to keep deve lopment and testing in synchronization. It is evident from the above studies that test automation is a crucial ingredient of agile soft‐ ware development projects.

Keywords: Agile Software Development , Peer Reviewed Conferences , Journals, Books 1. INTRODUCTION Agile software development methods are gaining widespread popularity across the globe, and many software organizations are using agile software development in the distributed set up. In distributed environment, agile team members are of ten distributed across multiple cities within the same or different countries. Differ ent cultural backgrounds, ethnicities and time differences add on to the geographical distances for weakening the cohesiveness of agile teams. Moreover, Use of agile practices in distributed environment is gaining popularity across the globe, mainly because it helps in re ducing manpower cost and also reduces ti me to market. To gain the maximum from both of these approaches, software organiza tions are using combination of agile software development in dis tributed set up. Software organizations are constantly scaling their agile practices beyond countries and continents [1]. The most crucial element on which teams gel in an agile setup is the existence of trust amongst it s team members [2]. Trust act as a cohesive force in agile software development teams, irrespective of the fact whether the team is collocated or distributed. The agile manifesto proactively emphasizes on existence of good interpersonal relationships, trust amongst team members and continuous customer collaboration over contract negotiation [3]. This study explores the role of trust in distributed agile software development teams by performing the light weight review of litera ture related to trust in distr ibuted agile environment. This paper is divided into seven sections. Section 1 provides brief overview about distributed agile software development and trust. Section 2 gives the background to agile methods, distributed software development and trust. In section 3, our research method and protocol was discussed. Section 4 presents results from our systematic literature review. Section 5 discuss the results and future work. Section 6 presents the limitations of this study and the l ast section conclude s the paper. 2. BACKGROUND In this section, we provide a brief overview of the agile software development, distributed agile software development and trust. 2.1 AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT Agile software development is based on iterative and incremental style of development. Agile software development is not a methodology in itself rather it is an umbrella term for several agile method ologies that includes Scrum, Extreme Programming (XP), Crys tal, Dynamic Systems Deve lopment Method (DSDM), Lean Development, and Feature -Driven Development (FDD). Each of these methodologies is driven by the vision and core values of agile manifesto. Agile Manifesto [4] states that agile software development should focus on four core values: • Individuals and interact ions over process and tools. • Working software over comprehensive documentation • Customer collaboration over contract negotiation • Responding to change over following a plan Agile software development methods are known to give prominence on continuous feedback, social interaction and collaboration among agile team members. Scrum and XP are considered to be the most widely adopted agile software development methodologies [5]. 2.2 DISTRIBUTED AGILE SO FTWARE DEVELOPMENT When software development teams are dist ributed across different cities, different countries, different continents then they are termed as distributed software development (DSD) teams. Global software development (GSD) is often used interchangeably for DSD. Today, many software organizations are using agile methods in DSD set up to take the benefits from both of these approaches [6]. Adopting and practicing agile practices like collaboration, face to face communication, daily stand up meetings and sprint retrospective meetings have become a chall enging task in distributed environment [7]. Collaboration and face to face communication are two biggest problems when agile methods are adopted in GSD set up [8]. Vax et al.

This article attempts to look at the importance to understand the required fundamental learning skills such as creative skill, critical skill etc. that facilitate the incorporation of knowledge appropriately . Thus, it is needed that a course must be studied systematically in terms of the required learning skills. In this paper, we present a novel evaluation scheme for a course that focus on the various sets of learning skills require d for each concept of the course. We employ Formal Concept Analysis on a complete set of questions prepared by experts covering all the concepts of a given course . This procedure generates a lattice of formal concepts, each presenting a group of questions that involve a common circle of learning skills to resolve them. These formal concepts can serve as performance parameters for assessing the students in a skill - centric fashion. Keywords: Learning Skills, Evaluation, Assessment, Performance Par ameters, Formal Concept Analysis. Introduction The present study focuses on evaluating a course in terms of its required learning skills. E valuation requires collection, analysis and interpreting information about learning a course in order to make cued decisions that improves student achievemen t and develop their learning skills [1-4]. Evaluation is a process that involves the following components: 1) Identifying and gathering relevant information 2) Having thoughts that are valuable and useful to learners in their lives and professions 3) Examining and interpreting information to learners. 4) Articulat e the purpose of the educational system In classroom teaching, teachers themselves analyze the questions and determine the learners’ weak points and their shortcomings. They then utilize these results of the assessment of their teaching to make their teaching practice more efficient. Assessment is basically performed in orde r to distinguish whether or not the learning has been successful or not as well as to clarify the expectations of the teachers from the pupils [5]. Assessment of learners focuses on these points: 1) Quantifying learners’ progress over time 2) Inspires learners to study effectively 3) Assessing the teaching methods 4) Ranking the learners’ abilities in relation to the whole class evaluation The main purpose of assessing and evaluating students is to determine thei r knowledge and abilities. The evaluation proce ss can focus on different aspects of teaching and learning . A prime concern in learning a course is whether learners attain the objectives of the curriculum. Objectives refer to the goals of a course of instruction . We consider the goal of learning a cour se S. Chakraverty Professor Department of Computer Engineering Netaji Subhas College of Engineering Sector 3, Dwarka, New Delhi apmahs.nsit@gmail.com is to develop the technique of applying a set of learning skills together to solve any kind of problem. There is a clear cut difference between assessment and evaluation. Assessment is one important aspect of evaluation. It only involves the measurement and analysis of information about student learning. The evaluation process goes beyond the stude nt achieve ment and it involves the educational decisions that are derived from various forms of assessments. The authors also believe that the purpose of evaluation is two -folds: one is to enhance student’s learning and the other is to help teachers to improvise the ir teaching practice as well [6 -9]. In this paper, w e put forward a method to comprehensively examine the questions pertaining to a course . Each question in the examination is tagged with different skills that are required to solve them. The questions in the examination are utilized to identify well -defined skills based performance parameters of the course . The assessed marks of the examination are utilized to evaluate the students’ in terms of these PPs to derive their kno wledge and the ability to apply these skills in various combinations to solve various problems. The contributions of this paper are summarized below: (i) We apply Formal C oncept Analysis (FCA) to draw up the lattice of formal concepts that depict the course domain in terms of sets of q uestions and the skills needed to resolve them. These formal concepts serves as effective skills - based Performance Parameters (PP) to assess students. To the best of our knowledge, it is for the first time that a formal method has been used to dissect a course in terms of the core learning skills that are required to use its concepts in solving complex problems effectively. (ii) We augment the traditional method of question -wise evaluation with an automated mechanism to examine groups of questions to evaluate t he skill levels attained by scholars. Formal Concept Analysis FCA offers a rationale for examining the data related to a domain of objects having certain attributes by mining conceptual entities from the data. Formal Context: It takes as input a data table, i.e. formal context A,B,I, that describes the relation I between the set of objects A and a set of attributes B [10, 11]. The notation a, bI show s object a has attribute b. Formal Concept: A formal concept is portrayed by a group of objects demonstrating a concept called Extensio n and a distinctive combination of attributes that is applicable for the entire group called Intension . For a formal context A, B , I, a formal concept is a pair X, Y of Extension XA and Intension YB such that X= Y and Y=X where, Xrepresents the set of all attributes that are common to the objects of X as computed in eq. 1: X= {b B | for each a  X: a, b I}, (1) Y represents the set of all objec ts sharing all attributes from Y calculated using eq. 2.",a novel evaluation scheme using formal concept analysis,a novel evaluation scheme using formal concept analysis

Keywords: Collaborative Learning , Learning Skills , Kernighan Lin Algorithm, Stable Marriages Problem . I. INTRODUCTION With the widespread and proactive participation of users through various online applications, r esearchers are now exploring the various ways of collaborating and clustering them based on their profile information [1]. Education resear ch and practices indic ate that Collaborative Learning ( CL) spurs discussion, facilitates mutual exchange of ideas, and generates a healthy learning atmosphere in which participants can measure up their relative strengths and weaknes ses to help each other improve. Academic discussion such as presented in [2 ] indicates that CL results in higher achievement, better psychological health, social competence and confidence among students . The advent of e -learning as a new , technology -enabled paradigm in education has give n a further fillip to CL. People across the globe, cutting across age, time and space constraints, can now cooperate to leverage the benefits of a diverse population covering a wide r socio -cultural spectrum . The core issue that must be addressed in CL is how to form learning groups in the best possible manner so that each student learns significantly more in a group than he or she would have learnt individually. An obvious requirement is that all collaborators must be able to communicate with each other and interact smoothly . In fact, t he bulk of research efforts in CL have focused on identif ying features that facilita te higher levels of interaction to create homogeneous or heterog eneous groups [3-9]. Many of these schemes form s collaborative groups on the basis of the intrinsic qualities of learners such as their personality traits [3], learning styles or cognitive styles [ 3, 4], interests [ 5] and learning abilities [6 -8]. Mentors distinguish that each learner possesses unique learning skills that impel her to learn and apply knowledge in distinct ive ways [ 9]. However, students do learn new skills and polish existing skills with interaction, guidance, and practice. Indeed, there is evidence of a shift in research direction towards skills analysis and skill -based grouping [10-12]. In [ 10, 11], the authors group learners based on their programming skills and show that skills -based grouping develops learners’ confidence and their retention power. The research work in [12 ] form s evenly skilled heterogeneous groups in which different skills such as technical writing, engineering , psychology etc. are distributed evenly in a group. In this paper, we create fruitful collaborations by clubbing together students based on their Learning S kills (LS) repertoire and their skills gap. The primary pedagogical goal of our study is to improve the students’ caliber through the mutual transfer of skills. We propose competitive and comple mentary collaborative pairs among students using (i) the Stable Marriages Problem (SMP) algorithm and (ii) th e recursive Kernighan -Lin ( KLin ) partitioning algorithm . The rest of the paper is organized in the following manner. Section 2 expounds upon our proposed scheme for competitive and complementary CL. In section 3, we discuss experimental results and we conclude our work in Section 4. II. LEARNING SKILLS BASED COLLABORATI VE LEARNING SCHEME The propose d system is designed to form learning skills based competitive and complementary collaborative pairs of co -learners regularly as a course proceeds. The system initially conducts a general pre -test for all registered learners to get an assessment of their inherent learning skills such as their analytical skill, mental skill, numerical skill or linguistic skill and generates initial collaborative pairs accordingly. Once the course is launched, regular examinations are conducted to gauge the performance of students on concepts imparted.

Chakraverty1, Sushma Hans2, and Vaibhav Mittal2 1Division of Computer Engineering, Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, Delhi, Delhi, India Abstract – A proposal scheme to personalize student s’ learning based on her learning aim in an e -learning environment . The system acknowledge s a distin ct set of students' aims that prioritize various Learning Objects (LOs) such as theory, case stu dies etc. acco rding to student's Learning A im (LA). We also propose a new way to model the course as a directed acyclic graph in which nodes at each level represent a collection of different perspectives for the same concept. All concept perspectives encapsulate a set of LOs. This allows students to strengthen their learning along both dimensions; depth of coverage as well as perspective breadth by suitably adding to her repertoire of multiple viewpoints contributed by different authors on the same concept. This paper illustrat es an Ant Colony O ptimization (ACO) based personalized e-learning scheme to generate an initially optimized path taking into account the priorit ies of learning objects and the contribution of concept persp ectives for different learning aims . Keywords: Personalized E -learning, Learning Objects, Learning Aims, Ant Colony Optimization, Directed Acyclic Graph, Concept Perspectives 1 Introduction The Internet has become a centerpiece of a learner’s educative environment, allowing her to learn at any time and any location conveniently [1]. Acknowledging the difference between diverse users' learning aims and their characteristics necessitate the need to create personalized environment for learning. A Personalized e -learning system tailors the cours es accordi ng to individual user s’ requirements and preferences. Enormous work has been done in the field of personalize d e- learning based on user profiles [ 2]. The profiles determine student behavior s that guide the e -learning system in generating a personalized pat h for each student. An i mmense variety of learning material a s well as different student’s learning preferences drives the need for more and more sophisticated personalization techniques and ideas. Studies mainly emphasize on adaptation of course material based on user's learning style, background, qualification and experience [ 3, 4, 5] . Existing systems do not recognize the relevance of ordering various LOs according to users’ Learning A im (LA) . As an example to explain the motivation for the work in this paper, let us suppose that a learner ’s aim for taking up a course is to carry out project work. Then the priority assigned to the various LOs may be order ed as: detailed theoretical concept, case study, and simulation . Another user who aims at gaining cursory knowledge on the subject can choose basic concepts followed by an example. Therefore, we need to bring in the primary aim of learning as a steering factor for personalizing a course. Further, for each concept that is part of the syllabus for a course , it can be explained by different authors from their own individual perspectives . Moreover, new perspectives that emerge when progress is made in the field must be added so that the course is regularly updated. On one hand, this allows the course to be enriched greatly by incorporating diverse ideas and viewpoints from different authors honed by individual experience. On the other hand, this also benefits learners by gaining maximally from the repository of perspectives according to their own needs, interests and time constraints. An optimized selection of these perspectives allows the learner to broaden her vision by studying different interpretations, thereby broadening her vision and aug menting her learning achievement . This paper proposes a framework that emphasizes the significance of user's LA while selecting the LOs as well as adding to the kitty of perspectives for grasping a concept. Section 2 presents a discussion of related work. Section 3 introduces the proposed framework for an e -course and implementation of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) based personalized learning path generation. In Sections 4 formalizes the experimental results. Section 5 discusses the simulation results. In S ection 6, we conclude the paper and give directions for future work. 2 Related Work The domain of personalized e -learning has benefitted from significant contributions made by different authors.

It caters to a wide spectrum of students with diverse backgrounds who enroll with their own learning aims. A core challenge under this scenario is to generate personalized learning paths so that each student can achieve her learning aim most effective ly. Prior works used static attributes such as prior knowledge level, learning ability, browsing prefe rences, learning style etc. to generate personalized learning paths. In this paper, we take an entirely new route by taking into account the continuous improvement of a learner in the light of her own learning aim, to redefine her learning path at each level of the course. We introduce the concept of personalized examination system that systematically evaluates the dynamic learning ability of every student according to her pre-set goals. The proposed intelligent e-learning system uses Ant Colony Optimization to iteratively optimize the forward learning paths . Experimental results reveal that the system is able to tap a student’s improved learning ability to choose more difficult paths that contribute highly towards her own aims. We demonstrate that the overall learning success of weaker students doubles as compared to statically generated paths while there is considerable improvement of 50% in the learning success for average students as well. This clearly indicates that our approach gives realistic benefits to initially weak students who gradually evolve as the course progresses.

INTRODUCTION The role of e-learning in modern education has grown significantly. As students and teachers are not constrained to be present at a particular location at the same time, the learning process can be carried out at an individual’s own pace in an any - place, any-time mode. Attractive features such as multimedia presentations, adaptive navigation al support, and self-assessment tests are incorporated to aid effective learning [1]-[6]. In order to fully realize the potential of self-paced learning in e-learning offerings, a core challenge that must be tackled is to create tailor-made learning paths for each and every learner based on her own educational goals and constraints. Current works tap the static learning attributes of students such as their pre-determined knowledge level, learning ability, learning style, and browsing behavior to offer personalized services [2] , [3], [4], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Prior works have largely ignored the fact that there are incremental improvements in the learning ability of a student as she proceeds in the course. Moreover, in an e- learning environment, every student enrolls with her own specific objective in mind. For example, a student with research interests should explore recent innovations and be able to bring in new ideas whereas another student whose purpose is to appear in an interview should focus on comprehensive coverage of basic concepts. In sharp contrast with previous e-learning approaches, we recognize the fact that a student’s learning ability is neithe r a fixed parameter nor can it be measured uniformly for all students. Rather, a student evolves to sharpen her grasping power continuous ly. Any e-learning system must incorporate a mechanism to assess such improvements, in the context of her preset goals. The main contributions of our work are summarized below: (i) All aspects of a student’s involvement with a course is aligned with her pre-specified Learning Aim (LA). We introduce the innovative idea of personalized examination which is designed and evaluated for each student in the context of her own LA. Furthermore, the system consciously selects those topics, learning objects and perspectives for each student, that are more relevant for achieving her desired LA. (ii) We propose and develop the Dynamic Learning Ability Based E-Learning System (D-LABELS) which actively leverages the benefits of continuous improvements achieved by a student. We introduce a new metric, the Learning-Aim oriented dynamic learning abilit y to quantify this varying personal trait. (iii) We employ the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) meta- heuristic to generate dynamically a new optimized future learning sub-path at each stage of the learning process. ACO maximizes the depth of learning as well the coverage of topics with minimum difficulty under given time constraints. The rest of the paper is organized in the following manner. In section 2, we review the current approaches to implement adaptive e-learning systems. Section 3 explains the e-learning model and its components. Section 4 elucidates the overall architecture of D-LABELS and the ACO algorithm with its objective and constraints. We evaluate experimental results in section 5 . We conclude our work in section 6 giving directions for future work. 2.

Besides the transportation cost, total time that includes travel time of a vehicle, loading and unloading times of products is also an important issue. Also, instead o f a single item, diﬀerent types of items may need to be transported from some sou rces to destinations through diﬀerent types of conveyances. The optimal transport ation policy may be af- fected by many other issues like volume and weight of per unit of prod uct, unavailability of suﬃcient number of certain types of vehicles, etc. In this paper , we formulate a multi-objective multi-item solid transportation problem by addressin g all these issues. The problem is formulated with the transportation cost and time par ameters as fuzzy variables. Using credibility theory of fuzzy variables, a chance-con straint programming model is formulated, and is then transformed into the correspond ing deterministic form. Finally numerical example is provided to illustrate the problem.

Pal, Fellow, IEEE Abstract —We propose a new archive-based steady-state micro genetic algorithm (ASMiGA). In this context, a new archivemaintenance strategy is proposed, which maintains a set of nondominated solutions in the archive unless the archive size falls below a minimum allowable size. It makes the archive sizeadaptive and dynamic. We have proposed a new environmen-tal selection strategy and a new mating selection strategy. Theenvironmental selection strategy reduces the exploration in lessprobable objective spaces. The mating selection increases search-ing in more probable search regions by enhancing the exploitationof existing solutions. A new crossover strategy DE-3 is proposedhere. ASMiGA is compared with ﬁve well-known multiobjectiveoptimization algorithms of different types—generational evolu-tionary algorithms (SPEA2 and NSGA-II), archive-based hybridscatter search, decomposition-based evolutionary approach, andarchive-based micro genetic algorithm. For comparison pur-poses, four performance measures (HV , GD, IGD, and GS) areused on 33 test problems, of which seven problems are con-strained. The proposed algorithm outperforms the other ﬁvealgorithms. Index Terms —Archive-based algorithm, genetic algorithms, multiobjective evolutionary optimization, Pareto front. I. I NTRODUCTION DEVELOPING methodologies for solving multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs) [ 37] has become an important area of investigation in the recent past. The main reason behind this is the multiobjective nature of various real-world problems for which often the objectives are con-ﬂicting in nature and often are required to satisfy a set of constraints. Consequently, simultaneous optimization of each objective is not possible. The goal of solving MOPs is not to ﬁnd an optimal solution; rather to ﬁnd a set of nondominated solutions. Without loss of generality, we can describe a constrained MOP as Manuscript received May 9, 2013; revised November 7, 2013 and April 4, 2014; accepted April 10, 2014.

A solution is feasible if it satisﬁes all the constraints; otherwise, it is infeasi- ble. There exists several deﬁnitions of constraint-domination; we use the one given in [ 1]. According to [ 1], a solution p constraint-dominates another solution qorp≺cqfor an M objective minimization problem, if any one of the following conditions is satisﬁed. 1) Solution pand qare both feasible and solution p dominates solution q,i.e.,p≺q. 2) Solution pis feasible and solution qis not. 3) Solution pandqare both infeasible, but solution phas a smaller “overall constraint violation.” A solution x*∈/RfracturNis said to be (globally or true) Pareto optimal if there exists no solution x∈/RfracturNsuch that f(x)constraint-dominates f(x*). The set of all Pareto opti- mal points is called Pareto Set and is denoted by PS.T h e set of all Pareto objective vectors is called (true) Pareto Front, PF={f(x)∈/RfracturM|x∈PS}. For many problems the number of Pareto optimal solutions is very large, may even be inﬁnite. In the last few decades, many multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) [ 1]–[19], [71]–[73] have been proposed to overcome the difﬁculties associated with MOPs. The out- put of any multiobjective optimization approach is a set of solutions. A good solution set should be: 1) as close as possible to the true Pareto front (PF); 2) uniformly distributed over the entire PF. For a given computational effort (maximum number of objec- tive function evaluations), a search algorithm should intensify the search on a particular region of the search space to satisfy the ﬁrst property of a good output solution set. On the contrary,for the second property, it needs to search the whole search region uniformly. Thus, our targets are conﬂicting because we have ﬁxed number of function evaluations. A good multiobjec-tive optimizer (MOO) must realize a good trade-off between exploration and exploitation to satisfy these properties. 2168-2267 c/circlecopyrt2014 IEEE.

C. Roy Engineering College, Durgapur-6, India sujit cse@yahoo.com 2Department of Mathematics, National Institute of Technology, Durgapur-9, India karsk@yahoo.com 3Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Durgapur-9, India tandra.pal@gmail.com Abstract This article proposes an algorithmic approach for multiple attribute group decision mak- ing (MAGDM) problems using interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy soft matrix (IVIFSM) and conﬁdent weight of experts. We propose a novel concept for assigning conﬁdent weights to the experts based on cardinals of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets (IVIFSSs). The conﬁdent weight is assigned to each of the experts based on their pre- ferred attributes and opinions, which reduces the chances of biasness. Instead of using medical knowledgebase, the proposed algorithm mainly relies on the set of attributes pre- ferred by the group of experts. To make the set of preferred attributes more important, we use combined choice matrix, which is combined with the individual IVIFSM to produce the corresponding product IVIFSM. This article uses IVIFSMs for representing the ex- perts’ opinions. IVIFSM is the matrix representation of IVIFSS and IVIFSS is a natural combination of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set (IVIFS) and soft set. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is validated using a case study from real life. 1 Introduction Molodtsov [1] introduced soft set theory as a generic mathematical tool for dealing with uncer- tain problems, which cannot be handled using tra- ditional mathematical tools such as theory of prob-ability [2], theory of fuzzy sets [3], rough set theory [4], and the interval mathematics. All these theories have their own inherent difﬁculties due to the inade-quacy of the parameterization. Molodtsov’s soft set[1] is free from such kind of difﬁculties, which can be used for approximate description of objects with- out any restriction. Due to this absence of restric-tion on the approximate description, soft set theoryhas been emerging as a convenient and easily appli-cable tool in practice. Since its introduction, soft set theory has been successfully applied in many different ﬁelds such as decision making [5-12], data analysis [13], fore- casting [14], simulation [15], optimization [16],texture classiﬁcation [17], etc. Maji et al.

To reduce the com munication burden, a reliable relative threshold strategy is proposed. Fourier series expansion and radial b asis function neural network are combined into a function approximator to model suitable time-varying dist urbed function of known periods in strict-feedback systems. By combining the Lyapunov stability theory and the backstepping technique, the proposed adaptive control approach ensures that all the signals in the closed- loop system are bounded, and the tracking error can be regulated to a compact set around zero in ﬁnite time. Fi nally, simulation results are presented to verify the eﬀectiveness of the theoretical results.

Some intelligent c ontrol approaches have been proposed to handle nonlinear systems, such as robust control [ 1,2], adaptive control [ 3–5], sliding mode control [6], cooperative control [ 7–10], and quantized nonlinear control [ 11]. In addition, more attention has been paid to approximation-based adaptive control for nonline ar systems [ 12–16], in which fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) or neural networks (NNs) are employed to ide ntify unknown nonlinearities. To mention a few, for a class of single-input and single-output nonstric t-feedback nonlinear systems, an adaptivefuzzytrackingcontrolmethod hasbeendevelopedin[ 17]byusingFLSstoapproximateunknown nonlinear functions. He et al. [ 18] investigated an adaptive impedance control problem for an n-link robotic manipulator by applying NNs to identify unknown nonlinearities , in which the robot was subject to full state constraints. By employing NNs to approximate the orig inally designed virtual controllers with unknown nonlinear items, an adaptive state-feedback contro l strategy was provided in [ 19] for robot manipulators with dead zone input. Asanimportantmethodtoreducethefrequencyofsignaltransm issionbetweensystemsandcontrollers, the event-triggered control has important theoretical and pra ctical signiﬁcance.

As we know, crossover operator plays a very important role on the performance of DE. However, the commonly used crossover operators of DE are dependent mainly on the coordinate system and are not rotation-invariant processes. In this paper, covariance matrix learning is presented to establish an appropriate coordinate system for the crossover operator. By doing this, the dependence of DE on the coordinate system has been relieved to a certain extent, and the capability of DE to solve problems with high variable correlation has been enhanced. More- over, bimodal distribution parameter setting is proposed for the control parameters of the mutation and crossover operators in this paper, with the aim of balancing the exploration and exploitation abilities of DE. By incorporating the covariance matrix learning and the bimodal distribution parameter setting into DE, this paper presents a novel DE variant, called CoBiDE. CoBiDE has been tested on 25 benchmark test functions, as well as a variety of real-world optimization problems taken from diverse ﬁelds includ- ing radar system, power systems, hydrothermal scheduling, spacecraft trajectory optimization, etc. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of CoBiDE for global numerical and engineering opti- mization. Compared with other DE variants and other state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms, CoBiDE shows overall better performance. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. 1. Introduction Differential evolution (DE), proposed by Storn and Price [1,2] in 1995, has become a hotspot in the community of evolutionary computation. Similar to other evolutionary algorithms (EAs), DE is a population-based optimization algorithm. In DE, each individual in the population is called a target vector. DE produces a mutant vec- tor by making use of the mutation operator, which perturbs a target vector using the difference vector of other individuals in the pop- ulation. Afterward, the crossover operator is applied to the target vector and the mutant vector to generate a trial vector. Finally, the trial vector competes with its target vector for survival according to their objective function values. Due to some advantages, e.g., simple structure, ease of implementation, and fast convergence speed, DE has been widely applied to some ﬁelds of science and engineering, ∗Corresponding author. E-mail addresses: ywang@csu.edu.cn (Y. Wang), mehxli@cityu.edu.hk (H.-X. Li), tingwen.huang@qatar.tamu.edu (T. Huang).such as cluster analysis [3], robot control [4], controller design [5], and graph theory [6]. It is noteworthy that in DE, the crossover operator depends mainly on the coordinate system and the distribution information of the population is usually unreasonably ignored. Moreover, the crossover operator of DE can be considered as a discrete recom- bination [7], and thus, the interactions among variables have not been systematically studied. As a result, DE often loses its effec- tiveness and advantages when solving problems with high variable correlation. In addition, DE is sensitive to its two main control parameters: the scaling factor F and the crossover control parameter CR. These two control parameters have a signiﬁcant impact on the perfor- mance of DE. Moreover, different control parameter settings show different characteristics [8]. For example, a larger F is effective for global search; however, a smaller F can accelerate the convergence. On the other hand, a larger CR results in higher diversity of the pop- ulation, since the trial vector will inherit more information from the mutant vector. However, a smaller CR focuses on local exploitation since the target vector will contribute more information to the trial vector. Indeed, it is still an open issue to choose suitable settings of 1568-4946/$ – see front matter © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Based on the knowledge of memristor and recurrent neural networks, the model of MNNs is established. Then, considering the state-dependent properties of memristor, a fuzzy model of MNNs is employed to provide a new way of an- alyzing the complicated MNNs with only two subsystems, and update laws for the connection weights of slave systems and controller gain are designed to make the slave systems exponentially lag synchronized with the master systems. Two examples about synchronization problems are presented to show the effectiveness of the obtained results, and an application of the obtained theory is also given in the pseudorandom number generator.

I NTRODUCTION Although current digital computers can now possess computing speed and complexity to emulate the brain functionality of animals like a spiders, mice, and cats [1], [2], the associated energy dissipa- tion in the system grows exponentially along the hierarchy of animal intelligence, as the sequential processing of fetch, decode, and execu- tion of instructions through the classical von Neumann bottleneck of conventional digital computers has resulted in less-efﬁcient machines as their ecosystems have grown to be increasingly complex [3]. For example, to perform certain cortical simulations at the cat scale even at 83 times slower ﬁring rate, the IBM team in [1] has to employ Blue Gene/P (BG/P): a super computer equipped with 147456 CPUs and 144 TBs of main memory. On the other hand, the human brain con- tains more than 100 billion neurons, and each neuron has more than 20 000 synapses. Efﬁcient circuit implementation of synapses, there- fore, is especially important to build a brain-like machine.

Digital Object Identiﬁer 10.1109/TFUZZ.2013.2294855since shrinking the current transistor size is very difﬁcult, introducing a more efﬁcient approach is essential for further development of neural network implementations. In 2008, the Williams group announced a successful fabrication of a very compact and nonvolatile nano scale memory called the memristor [4]. It was postulated by Chua [5] as the fourth basic circuit element in electrical circuits. It is based on the nonlinear characteristics of charge and ﬂux. By supplying a voltage or current to the memristor, its resistance can be altered [6]. This way, the memristor remembers information. Several examples of successful multichip networks of spiking neurons have been recently proposed [7]–[9]; however, there are still a number of practical problems that hinder the development of truly large-scale, distributed, massively parallel networks of very large scale integration (VLSI) neurons, such as how to set the weight of individual synapses in the network. It is well-known that changes in the synaptic connections between neurons are widely believed to contribute to memory storage, and the activity-dependent development of neural networks. These changes are thought to occur through correlated-based, or Hebbian plasticity. In addition, we notice neural networks have been widely studied in recent years, for their immense application prospective [10]–[23]. Many applications have been developed in different areas such as com- binatorial optimization, knowledge acquisition, and pattern recogni- tion. Recently, the problem of lag synchronization of coupled neural networks, which is one of the hottest research ﬁelds of complex net- works, has been a challenging issue because of its potential application such as information science, biological systems, and so on [24]–[36]. On the other hand, synchronization problem of neural networks has attracted great attention because of its potential applications in many ﬁelds such as secure communications, biological sys- tems, information science, image encryption, and pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) [37], [38]. Currently, a wide variety of synchronization phenomena have been investigated, such as complete synchronization [39]–[41], generalized synchronization [42], phase synchronization [43], and lag synchronization [44]. In the case of real applications, it is very hard to directly get the identical parameters of the master and slave systems. Therefore, adaptive synchronization may be a good choice for such cases. It is worth mentioning that in con- nected electronic networks, the occurrence of time delay is unavoidable because of ﬁnite signal transmission times, switching speeds, and some other reasons. Thus, the complete synchronization of neural networks is hard to implement effectively and it is more reasonable to consider the lag synchronization problem. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, the research on global exponential lag adaptive synchronization of memristive neural networks is still an open problem that deserves further investigation. To shorten sup gap, we investigate the problem of global exponential lag adaptive synchronization for a class of memristive neural networks with time-varying delays. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: 1) A model of MNNs is established in accor- dance with the memristor-based electronic circuits; 2) a fuzzy model of memristive neural networks is employed to give a new way to analyze the complicated MNNs with only two subsystems; 3) update laws are designed for the connection weights of slave systems and controller gain to make the slave systems exponentially lag synchronized with the master systems; and 4) a simulation example is presented to show the applications of the obtained results in the PRNG. 1063-6706 © 2013 IEEE.

It is known that the nonlinear H∞control problem can be trans- formed into solving the so-called Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equation, which is a nonlinear partial differential equati on that is generally impossible to be solved analytically. Even worse , model- based approaches cannot be used for approximately solving HJI equation, when the accurate system model is unavailable or costly to obtain in practice. To overcome these difﬁculti es, an off-policy reinforcement leaning (RL) method is introdu ced to learn the solution of HJI equation from real system data instead of mathematical system model, and its convergence i s proved. In the off-policy RL method, the system data can be generated with arbitrary policies rather than the evaluati ng policy, which is extremely important and promising for prac tical systems. For implementation purpose, a neural network (NN) based actor-critic structure is employed and a least-squar e NN weight update algorithm is derived based on the method of weighted residuals. Finally, the developed NN-based off-p olicy RL method is tested on a linear F16 aircraft plant, and furthe r applied to a rotational/translational actuator system.

This obviously established the relationship between the RL method and control community. Moreover, RL methods have the ability to ﬁnd an optimal control policy from unknown environment,which makes RL a promisingmethodfor control design of real systems. In the past few years, many RL approaches [5]–[23] have been introduced for solving the optimal control problems. Especially, some extremely important results were reporte d by using RL for solving the optimal control problem of discrete-time systems [7], [10], [14], [17], [18], [22]. Su ch as, Liu and Wei suggested a ﬁnite-approximation-error base d iterative adaptive dynamic programming approach [17], and a novel policy iteration (PI) method [22] for discrete-time nonlinear systems. For continuous-time systems, Murray et al. [5] presented two PI algorithms that avoid the necessity of knowing the internal system dynamics. Vrabie et al. [8], [9] , [13] introduced the thought of PI and proposed an important framework of integral reinforcement learning (IRL). Modar es etal. [21] developedanexperiencereplaybasedIRLalgorit hm for nonlinear partially unknown constrained-input system s. In [19], an online neural network (NN) based decentralized control strategy was developed for stabilizing a class of continuous-time nonlinear interconnected large-scale sy stems. In addition, it worth mentioning that the thought of RL methodshavealsobeenintroducedtosolvetheoptimalcontr ol problemof partial differential equation systems [6], [12] , [15], [16], [23]. However, for most of practical real systems, the existence of external disturbances is usually unavoidable . To reduce the effects of disturbance, robust controller is requiredfordisturbancerejection. One effectivesolutio n is the H∞control method, which achieves disturbance attenuation in theL2-gain setting [24]–[26], that is, to design a controller such that the ratio of the objective output energy to the disturbance energy is less than a prescribed level. Over the past few decades, a large number of theoretical results on nonlinear H∞controlhave beenreported[27]–[29], wherethe H∞control problem can be transformedinto how to solve the so-calledHamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs(HJI) equation.Howeve r,the HJI equationis a nonlinear partial differentialequation ( PDE), which is difﬁcult or impossible to solve, and may not have global analytic solutions even in simple cases. Thus,some workshavebeenreportedto solve theHJI equa- tion approximately [27], [30]–[35].

Email:{us11,barathram,msm }@iitbbs.ac.in Abstract —An assessment of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal quality has become an unavoidable ﬁrst step in most holter and ambulatory ECG signal analysis applications. In this paper, we present a simple method for automatically detection and classiﬁcation of ECG noises. The proposed method consists of four major steps: moving average ﬁlter, blocking, feature extraction, and multistage decision-tree algorithm. In the proposed method, the dynamic amplitude range and autocorrelation maximum peak features are extracted for each block. In the ﬁrst decision stage, a amplitude-dependent decision rule is used for detecting the presence of low-frequency (LF) noise (including, baseline wander (BW) and abrupt change (ABC) artifacts) and the high-frequency (HF) noise (including, power line interference (PLI) and muscle artifacts). In the second decision stage, the proposed method further classiﬁes the LF noise into a BW noise or a ABC noise using the local dynamic amplitude range feature. The HF noise is classiﬁed into a PLI noise or a muscle noise using the local autocorrelation maximum peak feature. The proposed detection and classiﬁcation method is tested and validated using a wide variety of clean and noisy ECG signals. Results show that the method can achieve an average sensitivity (Se) of 97.88%, positive productivity (+P) of 91.18% and accuracy of 89.06%. I. I NTRODUCTION Recently, wearable cardiac health care monitoring de- vices enable continuous recording of ECG signals, and early detection and treatment of cardiovascular diseases [1], [2]. Generally, the amplitudes of a normal ECG range from 10 µV to 5 mV and the frequency lies in the range of 0.05-150 Hz [3]. The ECG recordings are generally corrupted by noises, namely, baseline wander (BW), power line interference (PLI), muscle artifact (MA) and instrumentation noise. Furthermore, the motion artifacts is ubiquitous in ECG monitoring using wire- less body area networks (WBANs). From the corrupted ECG signals as shown in Fig. 1, it can be noted that the presence of BW, PLI and muscle noises causes inaccurate determination of ECG characteristic points, feature determination, heartbeat segmentation, etc. Thus, assessment of ECG signal quality has become an unavoidable ﬁrst step in most holter and ambulatory ECG signal analysis applications including cardiac arrhythmias recognition, heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, ECG-based biometric, continuous beat-to-beat blood pressure measurement, sleep apnea detection, and so on. Furthermore, signal quality assessment not only plays an important role in improving diagnostic accuracy of cardiovascular diseases diagnostic systems but also plays in selecting suitable ECG signal enhancement techniques.

E-mail: us11@iitbbs.ac.inParthapratim De Department of Electrical Engineering Shaqra University Al-Dawadmi, KSA. E-mail: pd4267@yahoo.com Abstract —Cognitive Radios exploit the unutilized spectrum by transmitting opportunistically without disturbing the primary user (PU) or licensed user. So, the sensing should be fast enough that the secondary user (SU) can vacate the spectrum when the PU becomes active. Cyclostationary methods perform better than energy detection methods in low SNR scenarios but they require large number of symbols. The objective of this paper to reduce the number of measurements in blind spectrum sensing (using QR decomposition and backward linear prediction) by employing multiple receive antennas. By using compressed sensing at the receiver front end helps to reduce the complexity of the A/D converter. Furthermore, in this paper, simulation results show that our method achieves a good probability of detection in very low SNR even at 50% measurements which is comparable to probability of detection at full measurements. I. I NTRODUCTION Cognitive radio is regarded as a substantial solution to spectrum scarcity issue by enabling the secondary user to dy- namically/adaptively access the frequency channels [1]. Spec- trum sensing improves utilization of spectrum by identiﬁcation of medium access control protocol [1]. Compressed sensing (CS) has led to a tremendous surge in cognitive radio and other applications due to high demand for fast, efﬁcient and in-expensive signal processing algorithms, applications and devices. In such situations, CS provides a promising solution [2], [3]. Compressed sensing enables sampling below the Nyquist rate without or with small reduction in reconstruction quality by exploiting the sparsity of signals in some transform domain and the incoherency of these measurements with the original domain. In essence, CS eliminates the need to acquire and store large number of samples by measuring minimum samples in some transform or basis that contain maximum information and hence saves space. Compressive sensing has seen major applications in diverse ﬁelds, ranging from signal processing, image processing, biomedical signal processing and many other applications. In compressed sensing, real world signals like sound, image, video etc., can be acquired using lesser linear measurements and throwing away some information due to inherent sparsity [4], [5]. In cognitive radio, wireless signals are typically sparse in frequency domain. In [6], compressed wideband sensing is used for cooperative spectrum sensing. In [7], [8] blind spec- trum detector is proposed based on compressed sensing using cyclic autocorrelation. To the best of our knowledge, there are few attempts towards the blind spectrum sensing usingcompressed sensing in very low SNR. This paper addresses a novel blind spectrum sensing method similar to [2], [9], [10], [11], [12], but requiring fewer measurements, by employing the concept of compressed sensing (sub-Nyquist sampling) [13], [14], [3]. Spectrum sensing in cognitive radio is a quite challenging task below the SNR wall (SNR value, below which detection is not possible) [9], [15]. Cyclostationary detectors [9], [11] perform well in low SNR or extremely noisy scenario rather widely used energy detector suffers with noise uncertainty problem. A major pitfall of the cyclostationary detector is that it requires large number of symbols and hence computational complex. Generally, cyclo-stationary methods need information about the primary signal such as modulation type, carrier frequency etc. to operate. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to sense the primary signals at very low SNR, by using much less symbols. Though, the novel algorithm is blind in nature so does not require any such information about the primary signal or the multipath channel, shadowing between the primary and secondary users. II.

Ramkumar and M. S. Manikandan School of Electrical Sciences Indian Institute of Techonology Bhubaneswar, INDIA Email:{mm10,us11,barathram,msm }@iitbbs.ac.in Abstract —In recent years, automatic signal detection and modulation classiﬁcation play a vital role in the ﬁeld of cognitive radio applications. The majority of the existing signals detection and classiﬁcation methods assume that the received signal is contaminated by additive white Gaussian noise. Under impulsive noise condition, the performance of the traditional modulation classiﬁcation methods may be degraded. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the application of sparse signal decomposition using an overcomplete dictionary for detection and classiﬁcation of digital modulation signals. The overcomplete hybrid dictionary consists of impulse waveform and sine and cosine waveform for effectively capturing morphological components of the impulse noise and deterministic modulated signals. The proposed modu- lation classiﬁcation method includes the following steps: sparse signal decomposition (SSD) on hybrid dictionaries, modulated signal extraction, matched ﬁltering, and maximum likelihood (ML) classiﬁcation. The performance of the direct ML and SSD-based ML classiﬁcation methods are tested and validated using different modulation techniques under different Gaussian and impulse noise conditions. The proposed system achieves a classiﬁcation accuracy of 89 percent at 0 dB SNR and hence outperforms the direct ML method. I. I NTRODUCTION In recent years, automatic modulation classiﬁcation (AMC) has taken a potential growth due to its usage in a variety of wireless communication application such as cognitive radio, electronic warfare and surveillance etc. [1]. AMC refers to identiﬁcation of modulation scheme of a received signal cor- rupted with noise. The design of the modulation classiﬁcation algorithm is very challenging as it has little or no knowledge of the signal transmitted [2]. The AMC algorithms can be commonly grouped into two broad categories: (i) likelihood-based (LB) decision-theoretic method and (ii) feature-based (FB) pattern recognition method. In likelihood-based method, the classiﬁcation is viewed as a multiple hypothesis-testing decision-making problem. LB based AMC gives an optimal solution. It classiﬁes the mod- ulation scheme by selecting the type of modulation which maximizes the likelihood function of the received signal [3]. Most of the modulation classiﬁcation algorithms considered additive white Gaussian noise in the performance analysis [3]. This assumption is not always sufﬁcient. There are many cases where noise in the communication channel is non- Gaussian. For example, the noises from various natural and man-made sources found in radio channels are non-Gaussianand exhibit sharp spike, i.e. they show impulsive characteristic [5]–[8]. The algorithms designed and developed for optimal results in Gaussian noise, exhibit worse performance in non- Gaussian noise environment [8]. Furthermore, it is found that the algorithms designed for white additive noise do not provide optimum results when additive noise is time correlated [6]. Most of the classiﬁcation algorithms proposed in non- Gaussian environment are feature based [2], that is, they utilize modulation dependent features of the signal [9]–[11]. If the features are not robust or properly designed, their performance degrades and hence they are suboptimal. In literature, a few previously published works addressed the recognition of modu- lation under non-Gaussian noise environments [2], [6], [12]. In [6], the classiﬁer uses the whitening ﬁlter to reduce complexity of ML in presence of non-Gaussian noise, where it estimates the unknown parameter and whitening ﬁlter coefﬁcients. The estimation approach degrades the performance of classiﬁer as it is difﬁcult to model it precisely. In [12], the channel and noise distribution are considered to be known. This motivates us to redesign a ML classiﬁer which can perform well in non- Gaussian environment. Recently, sparse representation (SR) has taken a substantial growth in many signal processing applications including de- noising, signal separation, compression in audio and biomed- ical signal processing [16]–[19]. In this paper, we propose a novel detection based classiﬁcation algorithm to identify the modulation scheme with additive mixed Gaussian and impulse noise using sparse signal decomposition with an overcomplete hybrid dictionary. Firstly, using SSD impulse is removed from the received signal followed by classiﬁcation of received signal using maximum likelihood based classiﬁer. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section II, we focus on the system model and motivation behind the ML classiﬁcation in the presence of non-Gaussian additive noise. The proposed method is presented in section III, which discusses the impulse removal using SSD of the received signal followed by ML classiﬁcation. The simulation results have been presented in section IV . Conclusions are drawn in Section V . II.

Manikandan and Barathram Ramkumar School of Electrical Sciences Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar, India {us11, msm, barathram }@iitbbs.ac.in Abstract —Automatic Modulation Classiﬁcation (AMC) is a essential component in Cognitive Radio (CR) for recognizing the modulation scheme. Many modulated signals manifest the property of cyclostationarity as a feature so it can be exploited for classiﬁcation. In this paper, we study the performance of digital modulation classiﬁcation technique based on the cy- clostationary features and different classiﬁers such as Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, k-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Neuro-Fuzzy classiﬁer. In this study we considered modulations i.e. BPSK, QPSK, FSK and MSK for classiﬁcation. All classiﬁcation methods studied using performance matrix including classiﬁcation accuracy and computational complexity (time). The robustness of these methods are studied with SNR ranging from 0to20dB. Based upon the result we found that combining cyclostationary features with Naive Bayes and Linear Discriminant Analysis classiﬁers leads to provide better classiﬁcation accuracy with less computational complexity. I. I NTRODUCTION Automatic Modulation Classiﬁcation (AMC) aims to detect the unknown modulation format employed in the received signal with a high probability of success and in a short period of time [1]. AMC has taken a signiﬁcant place in software deﬁned radio and cognitive radio. AMC plays important role in dynamic spectrum management and interference identiﬁcation. It has both military and civilian application. AMC also helps interoperability between various wireless standard as it is an intermediate step. AMC algorithms can be grouped into two different categories: Maximum likelihood (ML) and Feature Based (FB) meth- ods [2]. ML based technique exploits the probability density function (PDF) of the observed waveform and offers optimal solution but suffers from computational complexity. On the other side, FB methods employ some features for classiﬁcation at reduced complexity and nearly optimal. If these features are designed in a proper way then its performance is comparable to that of ML methods. Different types of features have been used in AMC e.g., wavelet transform, higher order cumulants and moments, cyclo-stationarity, instantaneous amplitude, phase, and frequency in [2]. Disadvantage of ML based method is that one should have either channel information or one must be able to estimate the channel based on their statistics. Feature based AMC is a two step process. First, signal features are extracted which is then fed to a classiﬁer for classiﬁcation. In cyclostationary based AMC, as the name suggests cy- clostationary features of the received signal are employed as in [3], [4] and [5]. For the cyclostationary signal, bothmean and autocorrelation are periodic, so spectral correlation function (SCF) can be calculated by taking fourier transform of cyclic autocorrelation. SCF exhibits peaks whose location and magnitude are unique for each modulation scheme. The peaks of SCF are captured by cyclic domain proﬁle (CDP). Using this CDP, modulation schemes can be classiﬁed. Aa mentioned earlier, classiﬁer is a integral part of feature based AMC. Neural Network (NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Naive Bayes (NB), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Neuro-Fuzzy (NF) are the some of the widely used classiﬁers. The design of classiﬁers is a very important in terms of computational complexity and the performance of classiﬁcation in the low SNR regime. The main objective of the paper is to ﬁnd a suitable classiﬁer that works well with cyclostationary features extracted from multiple modulation schemes. This paper is organized as follows: Section I describes the introduction about the AMC. In Section II, we have provided the cyclostationarity features in detail. Section III discusses different classiﬁers. Section IV presents all the simulation results and we ﬁnally concluded the paper in section V . II. C YCLOSTATIONARITY ANALYSIS If the mean and the autocorrelation of the random process s(t)is periodic i.e. µ(t+T)=µ(t) andRs(t+T,w+T)= Rs(t,w) for all t and w, then the process is said to be cyclostationary process. The conventional autocorrelation is given by Rs(τ)=E[s(t+τ 2)s(t−τ 2)] (1) For cyclostationary signal autocorrelation is periodic in T, then we can write as, Rs(t+T,τ) =Rs(t,τ) (2) Therefore one can expand it using Fourier series Rs(t+τ 2,t−τ 2) =/summationdisplay α0Rα0 se−j2πα0t(3) where,α0is k/T, for all k= 1,2,3....

So rapid sensing is required under the consideration that the secondary users (SU) have to vacate the spectrum within very less time, whenever the primary user(PU) is active. Cyclo-stationary based spectrum sensing methods are better than energy detection methods in negative signal-to-noise (SNR) decibel (dB) regime, in which case the noise variance cannot be exactly estimated. However blind cyclo-stationary methods require a large number of symbols (and hence measurements). The paper aims to reduce the number of measurements in a blind sensing method (using a combination of linear prediction and QR decomposition), by employing compressed sensing at the receiver front-end, so as to reduce the A/D requirements needed with large number of measurements, along with multiple receive antennas. It is to be noted that compressed sensing has not been earlier investigated at extremely low like SNR of −15dB. A comparison of few existing compressed sensing algorithms is undertaken, from the standpoint of spectrum sensing of extremely noisy signal, at highly negative SNR (dB). The proposed methods are also blind, and so do not require any information about the primary signal power, multipath channel distortions (between primary and secondary users) and band(s) occupied by the primary user and can be extended to the case when there are multiple primary users.",sparse representation for blind spectrum,sparse representation for blind spectrum

Hence, these techniques are not suitable for applications that require the imputation to be performed on demand and near real-time. The paper proposes a computational intelligence based architecture for online data imputation and extended versions of an existing offline data imputation method as well. The proposed online imputation techn ique has 2 stages. In stage 1, E volving Clustering Method (ECM) is used to replace the missing values with cluster centers, as pa rt of the local learning strategy. Stage 2 refines the resultant approximate values using a General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) as part of the global approximation strategy. We also propose extended versions of an existing offline imputation technique . The offline imputation techniques employ K -Means or K-Medoids and Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) or GRNN in Stage -1 and Stage -2 respectively. Several experiments were conducted on 8 benchmark datasets and 4 bank related datasets to assess the effectiveness of the proposed online and offline imp utation techniques. In terms of Mean A bsolute Percentage Error (MAPE) , the results indicate that the difference between the proposed best offline imputation method viz., K - Medoids+GRNN and the proposed online imputati on method viz., ECM+GRNN is statistically insignificant at a 1% level of significance. Consequently, the proposed online technique, be ing less expensive and faster, can be employed for imputation instead of the existing and proposed offline imputation tech niques. This is the significant outcome of the study. Further more, GRNN in stage -2 uniformly reduced MAPE values in both offline and online imputation methods on all datasets.

INTRODUCTION Missing data is observed in almost all of the real world datasets. Missing values result in less e f- ficient estimates because of sample bias and reduced sa mple size s. Most data mining alg orithms cannot work with incomplete datasets. For analyzing the available data, its completeness and quality play a major role, be cause the inferences made from complete data are more acc urate and reliable than those made fr om incomplete data [1].

Agricultural research, education and extension are said to be the most critical for prom oting farm productivity and enhancing farmer’s income. The public sector is major extension service provider and the reach of the public extension is limited in India and in addition it is burdened with non -extension responsibilities such as the distributi on of subsidies and inputs, with little time left to attend to core extension activities. The objective of the article is to review the agricultural extension system in India to suggest pathways for better extension system in India. The public extension se rvices are highly skewed towards crop husbandry ignoring allied sectors in India. Over the years the understaffed extension departments are burdened with non -extension works. The growth in the High -Value Agriculture sector has been twice or sometimes even thrice that of the crop production. However, Agriculture extension services for such sectors almost nil or unorganized. Further, extension personal are less than the recommended ratio of 1:750 at a national level. Hiring and training sufficient number of e xtension professionals in the sector can significantly contribute to the farmer’s income. India spent just 0.7 per cent of Agriculture GDP on agriculture research and education which includes extension and training, which is par below the recommended 2 per cent by the World Bank. The Government vision of achieving doubling of farmer’s income by 2022 without the successful delivery of agricultural extension to rural smallholder farmers is a daunting task if the issues not addressed timely. Key words: Agricu lture extension, Extension approaches, Meta analysis, India ndia predominantly an agrarian rural economy, with around 69 per cent of its population living in rural areas (Aayog 2017) and around 47 per cent of the workforce engaged in agriculture (La bour Bureau 2015 -16). There are 138 million agricultural holdings in India, of which around 85 per cent are small and marginal farmers1 (Census 2010 - 11). The majority of them are poor (Mahendra Dev 2014) . In a predominantly rural economy with high dependency on agriculture for rural household livelihoods, growth in agriculture is vital in order to ensure fairness in food and 1Average size of operational holdings in India is 1.4 hectares (Thapa 2009 ) nutritional security in the rural area. There is a strong relationship between agricultural growth and reduction in poverty and malnutri tion and creating equitable society as compared t o growth in any other sector. In the context of the Indian government’s push to double farm income by 2022, the thrust placed on smallholder farmer is fair and visionary. Agricultural research, education an d extension are said to be the most critical for promoting farm productivity and enhance income amongst various types of government spending for agriculture.

Keratin function has played a signiﬁcant role in the natural selection of an organism. Hence, it acts as a marker of evolution. Much information about an organism and its evolution can therefore be obtained by investigating this important protein. In the present study, Keratin sequences were extracted from public data repositories and various important sequential, structural and physicochemical properties were computed and used for preparing the dataset. The dataset containing two classes, namely mammals (Class-1) and non- mammals (Class-0), was prepared, and rigorous classi ﬁcation analysis was performed. To reduce the complexity of the dataset containing 56 parameters and to achieve improved accuracy, feature selection was done using the t-statistic. The 20 best features (parameters) were selected for further classi ﬁcation analysis using computational algorithms which included SVM, KNN, Neural Network, Logistic regression, Meta-modeling, Tree Induction, Rule Induction, Discriminant analysis and Bayesian Modeling. Statistical methods were used to evaluate the output. Logistic regression was found to be the most effective algorithm for classi ﬁcation, with greater than 96% accuracy using a 10-fold cross validation analysis. KNN, SVM and Rule Induction algorithms also were found to be ef ﬁcacious for classi ﬁcation. &2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 1. Introduction Among different biological paradoxes existing presently, exact and efﬁcient classi ﬁcation of organisms remains top priority. It is of paramount importance due to its pressing need in basic and applied bioscience research. Immense morphological, anatomical and genetic complexity of individual organism has made this problem almost unsolvable since time immemorial. Increase in the interdisciplinary approaches for tackling dif ﬁcult problems in science, availability of heap of molecular data in the public data repositories and revolution in the existing machine learning methodologies provides us an opportunity to explore this classical issue of biological sciences. According to Mayr and Bock, biological classi ﬁcation refers to the categorization of the entities in a hierarchical manner where every hierarchy consists of closely related classes [1]. In simple terms, a class is known as a cluster of similar entities, when presence of common traits or attributes in a collection is con- sidered as similar [1]. Linnaeus introduced the concept ofbiological classi ﬁcation based on common physical features as a means for grouping species [2]. Continuous methodological revi- sions for grouping species have been performed by the experts including modern molecular phylogenetic techniques to meet the criteria of the Darwinian principles. Till we receive the exact answer, changes in scienti ﬁc approaches to achieve the same are likely to continue. Understanding each organism based on a complete set of criteria is almost impossible, therefore, an effort is made here to classify mammals and non-mammals taking into account various properties (56) of a single important protein molecule, i.e., Keratin. This particular protein was selected due to its structural and functional intricacies and importance. Among different structural protein families, Keratin is a sig- niﬁcant one. It is ﬁbrous in nature and acts as a structural part of nails, hairs and outer skin layer. Assembled units of Keratin monomers form ﬁlament bundles to develop unmineralized tis- sues in different species. Keratinocytes are rich in ﬁlaments of Keratin especially in corni ﬁed epidermal layer. Basically, two types of Keratins are found, namely, α- and β-Keratins. Though it is beyond proof at present, it is speculated that different body parts of dinosaurs were composed of various types of Keratins [3]. Based on the intermediate ﬁlament, Keratins are of different types, among which polymers of type I and type II intermediateContents lists available at SciVerse ScienceDirect journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/cbmComputers in Biology and Medicine 0010-4825/$ - see front matter &2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Hence, mobile banking is an emerging delivery channel for modern banking systems. In the international scenario mobile banking have been successful in MPESA, GCash, DoCoMo and M-Pay in Poland but the adoption of mobile payments have not been very successful in Europe and United States (Dahlberg et al., 2008). Beginning in 2008, rudimentary banking services are being offered through the mobile phone.

Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Multilayer Perceptron, and SVM to test a research model with fourteen independent variable s and a dependent variable (adoption). A survey was c onducted and the results were analysed using these tech- niques. Using Decision Trees the profile of the mobi le banking adopter’ s profile was identified. Comparin g different machine learning techniques it was found that Decision Trees outperformed the Logistic Regre ssion and Multilayer Perceptron and SVM. Out of all the t echniques, Decision Tree is recommended for profilin g studies because apart from obtaining high accurate results, it also yields ‘if–then’ classification rul es. The classification rules provided here can be used to ta rget potential customers to adopt mobile banking by of- fering them appropriate incentives.

We developed an ensemble system incorporating majority voting and involving Multilayer Perceptron (M LP), Logistic Regression (LR), decision trees (J48), Random Forest (RF), Radial Basis Function (RBF) network and Support Vector Machine (SVM ) as the constituents. The dataset was taken from the Business Intelligence Cup organised by the University of Chile in 2004. Since it is a highly unbala nced dataset with 93% loyal and 7% churned customers, we employed (1) undersampling, (2) oversampling, (3) a combination of undersampling and oversampling and (4) the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) for balancing it. Furthermore, tenfold cross-validation was employed. The results indicated that SMOTE achieved good overall accuracy. Also , SMOTE and a combination of undersampling and oversampling improved the sensitivity and overall accuracy in majority voting. In addition, the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) was used for the purpose of feature selection. The reduced feature set was fed to the classifiers mentioned above. Thus, this paper outlines the most important predictor variables in solving the cr edit card churn prediction problem. Moreover, the rules generated by decisi on tree J48 act as an early warning expert system.

We use a form called punctuator which is non-propositional and also non-set- theoretic to build our system – Neo-Vaiśesika Formal Ontology . The idea is to present an ontological language which is formal. This language is a set of potentially infinite sentences (graphs) whose structure is captured by a finite set of (graph) grammar rules. We also have an interpreter to interpret the graphs generated by this grammar and show that the interpretation of a node as belonging to a particular ontological category is based purely on its structure/form and nothing else to provide a robust example of a formal, foundational and generative ontology. Keywords . Formal Ontology, Graph Grammar, Generative Ontology, Punctuator, Generative Grammar, Vaiśesika Introduction Most, if not all, of the (computational) ontologies built till now [12] are either built manually or through automatic methods of category-extraction from text. There is no notion of generation there since there are no repeating structures (each category is different and hence different structure). All the foundational ontologies are presented as diagrams/graphs with finite number of nodes (which stand for categories/sub-categories) and edges (which stand for class-subclass or some other relations). In this paper we present a novel concept of Generative Ontology which presumes Grammar of Reality which, in turn, is based on the idea of a recursive ontological form called the punctuator. A punctuator is a form which is present between any two entities and enables us to distinguish one from the other. It is because of this form that we are able to differentiate various categories as well as different instances of the same category. Since a punctuator is found not only between two classes, but also between two particulars, or between a class and a particular, the graphs which are based on punctuators contain not only Copyright © 2015 for this paper by its authors. Copying permitted for private and academic purposes.classes/universals, but also particulars. But since the punctuator has a recursive form, complex graphs can be generated from simple graphs, and each of these graphs depicts some or other portion of reality at some or other level of granularity. Hence we also have an interpreter to interpret the generated graphs as portions of reality. We take Vaiśesika - one of the Indian philosophical schools which focuses on foundational ontology – as formalized in [4,5,6,7] as our base, and present generative as well as interpretative grammars for it in this paper. Thi s paper's focus is not on defending Vaiśesika description of reality or the rationale behind its categorial system1. This paper is already taking them as given and trying to make implicit formal notions of Vaiśesika explicit. The idea is to show the possibility of an ontological language which can be formalized and also generated, and then interpreted. In section 1 we present Vaiśesika ontology in brief. In section 2 we present Neo-Vaiśesika Formal Ontology, the system we built by formalizing Vaiśesika ontology. In this section, we give formal definitions of Vaiśesika categories in terms of three basic punctuators. In section 3 we show how Vaiśesika can be seen as a generative ontology. In section 3.1, we give the generative grammar of our system where we give the production rules to generate graphs, and in section 3.2 we give interpretative rules using which we can interpret these generated graphs to label each node with some or other Vaiśesika category. The generated graph is considered to be valid if there is at least one interpretation, in terms of Vaiśesika categories, of the generated graph. The grammar is considered to be sound if it generates only valid Vaiśesika graphs. Though a formal proof of the soundness of this grammar is not achieved yet, we present in section 4 some results which show that the system is promising. The main focus of the paper is to present the idea of a generative ontology and one example of such an ontology. We tried to provide examples and explanation of abstract concepts wherever possible but due to space constraints we are unable to get into detailed explanation sometimes.

Due to this cyber crime has been rapidly increasing its footfall on Indian economy. There are various kind of cyber crimes, creating impact and threat to the economy of a nation and even disturbing peace and the security. This research paper emphasis on how cyber crime is having hazardous effect on Indian economy as it move towards the new investment, digitalization and demonetization. It is increasing the risk factor. Therefore there is need for a holistic approach to combat these crimes and try to find remedies for it. So that we can drag our Indian econo my towards developing economy, not the underdeveloped economy and its effects could be more profound. And we can witness the new horizon of cyber crime free Indian economy. Key words: Cyber Crime, Cyber Espionage, Digitalization, Demonetization, Economic Growth, Risk Factors I. INTRODUCTION With Internet becoming household commodity in India, the cyber crime has become major concern today. Any crime committed using computer and Internet is referred as cybercrime. This crime can be against a person, business or non-business organization or government. It has a serious impact on our economy, as well as on our society. According to various surveys and reports, cyber crime is affecting various industries and is increasing the risk factors [1-3]. Political & Governance Instability holds its position at 6th, as per the India Risk Surveys’ for 2017 and 2016 respectively. It affects almost every sector in Indian economy like- retail, financial services, health care, banking, stock market, IT sector etc. In this digitalization era, Cyber crime is the biggest risk for the Indian economy. It transforms and impede the business world to give exposure of both opportunities and threats. Thus, we conclude that cybercrime continues to extent – ranking as this year's second most reported economic crime [2]. In India, cyber crime is increasing at the rate of 50% per year [2]. Number of cyber crime incidents are increasing with rapid speed. Earlier, this attack requires experienced computer literate persons, but now a days it is easier for even the layman. The foremost reason for the increase in cyber attacks is difficulty in tracing the action and the person behind it. Further, cyber attacks can be committed remotely from any part of the world targeting any number of population. Due to these reasons, cyber security and Information security has taken centre-stage. “Cybersecurity is going to be a big problem in 2018. I guess there is an outside possibility we may see some devastating attacks in 2018” as per Richard Fenning, CEO, Control Risks [4]. The lot of research is ongoing to protect the data/databases on the web [5-9] and to secure the cyberspace [10]. In this manuscript we aim to fulfil following objectives: 1) To comprehend how cybercrime is affecting economical development in India. 2) To study the factors or determinants related to crime that play vital roles in the development of economy of any nation. 3) To get acquainted with the above identified factors effecting cyber crime. 4) To study and reduce the factors responsible for having effect on Indian economy. Section 2 discusses various types of cyber crime existing in cyberspace. In section 3, we discuss various risks factors for development in economy followed by the impact of cyber crime on Indian economy in section 4. Section 5 enlist suggestions to combat cyber crime followed by section 6 which concludes our paper. II. TYPES OF CYBER CRIME IN INDIA There are many types of cyber crimes, from which we should be aware so as to prevent them. Various types of Cybercrimes identified are as follows [11]: A. Cyber stalking This type of cyber crime creates physical threats using technologies such as smart phones, email, messages, websites or videos. Assault by threatening a person or his family members using computer/internet also comes in this category of crime. B. Child pornography This crime involves the misuse of advanced communication technology by sexually exploiting underage children. In this case, computer networks are used to create, distribute, or access such objectionable materials. C. Cyber laundering This type of cybercrime involves online transfer of currency with an intension to hide its source and destination. D. Cyber terrorism This type of crime includes use of technology for destruction or to harm a person or organization. This crime includes hacking and cyber theft. All the activities like DNS cache poisoning, identity theft, fraud, sending spam messages, phishing, plagiarism, and piracy. Other prevailing attacks are: 1) Hardware Hijacking: This is hijacking of networking equipment. In 2015, CISCO has issued an alert stating attackers are gaining physical access to Cisco IOS devices and replacing them with a malicious ROMMON image. 2) Script kiddies: Amateur hackers comes under this categories. They attack weakly secured systems.",ijsrd - international journal for scientific research development vol 5 issue 10 2017 issn (online): 2321- 0613,ijsrd - international journal for scientific research development vol 5 issue 10 2017 issn (online): 2321- 0613

Keywords —Machine Learning, Detection, Prediction, SVM, Naïve Bayes, KNN, ANN . I. INTRODUCTION Machine Learning (ML) can access data and use it for self - learning. The main motto is to allow the computers to learn automatically without human intercession or collaboration and adjust actions according to it. Fig.1 Basic ML Model Fig.1 shows the steps involved in ML process. ML Model consists mainly of four steps: environment, learning, repository and execute [1]. Environment means to acquire outside information. Quality of information affect directly on learning to understand whether easy or clutter. Learning means to get the knowledge from information and that knowledge is added to the repository which stores many general principles that guide the implementation activities. Thomas H. Davenpo rt writes in the Wall Street Journal, “Humans can typically create one or two good models a week (while) machine learning can create thousands of models a week""[2]. Machine Learning Techniques: Fig. 2 shows the Machine learning classification techniques is divided into following category [4, 5]: A. Supervised Learning, B. Unsupervised Learning, C. Reinforcement Learning. D. Semi -supervised Learning Fig.2. Machine learning Classification technique A. Supervised learning It recognize s a labelled data set and is divided into two types: classification and regression [3]. Supervised learning is widely used in different -different applications, like speech recognition, spam detection and object recognition [6]. Supervised learning, if appli ed with proper data, the error rate can be reduced tens to the minimum error rate bound [3]. Table 1 describes the tasks performed using supervised learning , the algorithms used for performing the tasks and application domains. Table1.

INTRODUCTION In this new era of digital innovations, data plays a pivotal role. Owing to the increased use of databases, it has become increasingly vulnerable to copyright and piracy threats. With this, the need to protect them arises. Technological protection methods1 (TPMs) backed by legal anti-circumvention measures offer a cost-effective solution to database protection. TPMs include the technologies that are used to control access to copyright content or to prevent users from copying protected content. Watermarking of digital databases is one such TPM that has emerged as an effective means to protect shared and outsourced data from unauthorized access. Robust digital watermarking techniques aim at ownership protection. Normally, robust watermarking algorithms introduce small changes in the data throughout the database, albeit in manner that it does not render the data completely unusable. However, there are databases that contain sensitive information such as those used in medical and military applications where even the slightest distortions cannot be tolerated. In particular, categorical data assume a fixed and limited number of values and even a small change can lead to a change in category itself. It is therefore a challenge to implement robust watermarking in a database that contains predominantly categorical data. In this paper, authers proposed a distortion-free, robust watermarking technique for watermarking categorical attributes to resolve ownership verification. 2. RELATED WORK Watermarking databases mainly resolves two important issues: proof of ownership and tamper detection. A robust technique provides ownership proof whereas a fragile watermark detects any tamperness in the database. Agrawal2, et al. proposed robust watermarking technique to insert marks in the numeric attributes. They embedded the watermark by resetting the algorithmically determined least significant bit of a specific attribute. This technique is not resilient to bit-based attacks. Farfoura3, et al. proposed time-stamping protocol to resolve additive attacks. The embedding process was reversible so that original values can be regained. Shehab4, et al. and Khanduja5, et al. utilized statistical properties of the data-set to embed watermark into the numerical attribute. They framed watermarking problem as a constrained optimization problem and discuss the efficient techniques to solve it. Several other notorious works is proposed in literature to watermark numeric attributes6-9. Watermarking in non-numeric attributes requires different approach as bit-flipping does not work here10,11. Watermark is embedded using non-repetitive nature of occurrence of a vowel in a non-numeric attribute value10. A vowel is appended to the selected attribute depending upon the key value generated for a tuple. In robust database watermarking schema, there is an underlying assumption that all watermarked attributes can Watermarking Categorical Data : Algorithm and Robustness Analysis Vidhi Khanduja!,*, Shampa Chakraverty!, and Om Prakash Verma# !Deptt. of Computer Engineering, Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, Delhi-110 078, India #Deptt. of Computer Science and Engineering, Delhi Technological University, Delhi-110 042, India *E-mail: vidhikhanduja9@gmail.co m ABSTRACT The importance of watermarking digital databases has increased by leaps and bounds due to the high vulnerability of digital assets to piracy attempts when they traverse through the internet. To deter piracy, we propose a robust watermarking scheme for relational databases containing categorical data that resolves ownership issues. We propose a three-level security strategy. Firstly, the watermark is itself made secure using playfair cryptographic algorithm. Secondly, the database is securely partitioned using a primary key independent hash partitioning technique. This step virtually reorders the tuples before embedding. Thirdly, we entail a secret key based embedding process to ensure security. Linear feedback shift registers are implemented to generate pseudorandom numbers which selects different watermark bit index for each partition. The process of embedding does not produce any distortion in the database. Hence it is suitable for databases with categorical attributes containing sensitive information that cannot tolerate perturbations. Each watermark bit is embedded multiple times into different partitions. This makes the scheme highly robust against various attacks. The technique is proved by experimentally, and by theoretical analysis to be extremely robust. Experimental results show that it is 400 per cent resilient to subset addition attack, 100 per cent resilient to subset alteration attack, and 96 per cent resilient to tuple deletion attack. We prove analytically the resilience of the proposed technique against invertibility and additive attacks.

Although a plethora of performance metrics have been proposed in the MOO context, there has been a lack of insights on the relationships between metrics. In this paper, we ﬁrst group the major MOO metrics proposed to date according to four core performance criteria considered in the literature, namely Ca- pacity ,Convergence ,Diversity , and Convergence–Diversity . Then, a comprehensive study is conducted to investigate the relation- ships among representative group metrics, including Generational Distance (GD), ϵ-indicator (I1 ϵ+),Spread (∆),Generalized Spread (∆),Inverted Generational Distance (IGD) and Hypervolume (HV). Experimental results indicated that these six metrics show high consistencies when Pareto fronts (PFs) are convex, whereas they show certain contradictions on concave PFs.

I NTRODUCTION Multiobjective Optimization Problems (MOPs) involve sev- eral conﬂicting objectives to be optimized simultaneously [1– 5]. A plethora of approaches, such as Multiobjective Evolu- tionary Algorithms (MOEAs), have been well established as efﬁcient methods to deal with MOPs that are now prevalent in the ﬁelds of engineering, ﬁnance, logistic, etc [1–40]. To evaluate different approaches, it is critical to design ap- propriate performance metrics in various context. For instance, the goal of Single-objective Optimization Problems (SOPs) is to ﬁnd an optimal solution with regards to minimization or maximization. It is relatively easy in SOPs to compare two solutions and regard the one with a better ﬁtness as superior. In MOPs, however, evaluating solution superiority is much more complex due to the presence of conﬂicting objectives. Various approaches often obtain an optimal solution set comprising a number of solutions that fair equivalently according to Pareto dominance concept [1–19]. However, it is often non-trivial to provide a quantitative comparison of different optimal solution sets in Multiobjective Optimization (MOO) [1–5]. To date, a number of quantitative metrics have been pro- posed in MOO for deﬁning solution set optimality and the assessment of MOEAs [4–6, 41–45]. Each metric is designed with a standpoint that takes one or more performance cri- Siwei Jiang, Yew-Soon Ong, Jie Zhang, Liang Feng are with the School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore 639798 (e-mail: {sjiang1, asysong, zhangj, feng0039 }@ntu.edu.sg). Manuscript received August 20, 2013; Revised January 2, 2014; Accepted February 11, 2014teria into considerations. The typical performance criteria1 include the capacity of the non-dominated solutions set, the convergence of solutions to true Pareto fronts (PFs), the diversity of solutions in the objective space, the dominated volume of solutions with respect to the reference sets, etc. For instance, Van Veldhuizen et al. [41] designed metrics to tally the number of non-dominated solutions. The Generational Distance (GD) metric [6, 42] is introduced to measure the proximity of solutions to the true PFs. Zhou et al. [43] deﬁned theGeneralized Spread (∆∗) metric to measure the diversity of solutions on high dimensional MOPs. Zitzler et al. [44, 45], on the other hand, established the popular Hypervolume (HV) metric to calculate the dominated volume of the optimal solution sets, with respect to the reference sets. With the plethora of performance metrics that have been proposed in the last decade, research efforts devoted to surveys on MOO metrics have also emerged alongside [46–51]. For instance, Okabe et al. [46] in their survey categorized MOO metrics in terms of cardinality, distance, volume, distribution and spread. Zitzler et al. [47] classiﬁed the MOO metrics using a mathematical framework. After analysing the classical MOO metrics, Tan et al. [48] proposed the Uniform Distribution (UD) as a parameter dependent metric. Wu et al. [51], on the other hand, summarized six variants of metrics associated with HV, and studied them on a bi-objective engineering MOP. It is worth noting that several notable surveys, experimental studies and analyses made on MOO metrics [46–51] have been limited to a focus on individual metric. Little or no work on establishing the relationships among MOO metrics have been explicitly considered to date. This paper thus makes an attempt to ﬁll in this gap. In particular, we begin with a categorization of existing MOO metrics into four groups according to the core performance criteria typically used in the literature, namely Capacity ,Convergence ,Diversity , and Convergence–Diversity . With the categorization, we are then able to systematically study the relationships among representative group metrics on the symmetric and continuous PFs. More speciﬁcally, we investigate six representative metrics, including Generational Distance (GD), ϵ-indicator (I1 ϵ+),Spread (∆),Generalized Spread (∆∗),Inverted Generational Distance (IGD) and Hy- pervolume (HV). Experimental studies indicated that all the six metrics show high consistencies when the Pareto Fronts (PFs) are convex. Surprisingly, contradictions among metrics are found on concave PFs, even on metrics of the same group that cater to a common performance criterion. 1Performance criteria in MOO: the particular standard of the true quality of optimal solution sets, i.e., capacity, convergence, diversity.",consistencies and contradictions of performance,consistencies and contradictions of performance

In the meanw hile, it poses challenges for the Gaussian process (GP) regressio n, a well-known non-parametric and interpretable Bayesian mod el, which suffers from cubic complexity to data size. To improve the scalability while retaining desirable prediction qual ity, a variety of scalable GPs have been presented. But they have no t yet been comprehensively reviewed and analyzed in order to b e well understood by both academia and industry. The review of scalable GPs in the GP community is timely and important due to the explosion of data size. To this end, this paper is devot ed to the review on state-of-the-art scalable GPs involving tw o main categories: global approximations which distillate the en tire data and local approximations which divide the data for subspace learning. Particularly, for global approximations, we mai nly focus on sparse approximations comprising prior approxima tions which modify the prior but perform exact inference, posteri or ap- proximations which retain exact prior but perform approxim ate inference, and structured sparse approximations which exp loit speciﬁc structures in kernel matrix; for local approximati ons, we highlight the mixture/product of experts that conducts m odel averaging from multiple local experts to boost predictions . To present a complete review, recent advances for improving th e scalability and capability of scalable GPs are reviewed. Fi nally, the extensions and open issues regarding the implementatio n of scalable GPs in various scenarios are reviewed and discusse d to inspire novel ideas for future research avenues.

I NTRODUCTION IN the era of big data, the vast quantity of information poses the demand of effective and efﬁcient analysis, interpretat ion and prediction to explore the beneﬁts lie ahead. Thanks to the big data, the machine learning community tells many success stories [1]–[4] while still leaving many challenge s. We focus on Gaussian process (GP) regression [5], also known as Kriging in geostatistics [6], and surrogates or emulator s in computer experiments [7]. The GP is a non-parametric statistical model which has been extensively used in variou s scenarios, e.g., active learning [8], multi-task learning [9], [10], manifold learning [11], and optimization [12]. Big data in the GP community mainly refers to one of the 5V challenges [13]: the volume which represents the huge amount of data points to be stored, processed and analyzed, incurring high computational complexity for cur rent Haitao Liu is with the Rolls-Royce@NTU Corporate Lab, Nanya ng Tech- nological University, Singapore, 637460.

It is worth noting that this review mainly focuses on scalable GPs for large-scale regression but not o n all forms of GPs or other machine learning models. Givenntraining points X={xi∈Rd}n i=1and their observations y={yi=y(xi)∈R}n i=1, GP seeks to infer the latent function f:Rd∝ma√sto→Rin the function space GP(m(x),k(x,x′))deﬁned by the mean m(.)and the kernel k(.,.). The most prominent weakness of standard GP is that it suffers from a cubic time complexity O(n3)because of the inversion and determinant of the n×nkernel matrix Knn=k(X,X). This limits the scalability of GP and and makes it unaffordable for large-scale datasets. Hence, scalable GPs devote to improving the scalability of full GP while retaining favorable prediction quality for big data. The extensive literature review summarized in Fig. 1 classiﬁes scalable GPs into two main categories including (a)Global approximations which approximate the kernel matrixKnnthrough global distillation. The distillation can be achieved by (i) a subset of the training data with m (m≪n) points (subset-of-data [14]), resulting in a smaller kernel matrix Kmm; (ii) the remove of uncorrelated entries in Knn(sparse kernels [15]), resulting in a sparse kernel matrix ˜Knnwith many zero entries; and (iii) the low-rank represen- tation measured between minducing points and ntraining points (sparse approximations [1], [16]–[18]), resulting in the Nystr¨ om approximation Knn≈KnmK−1 mmKmn. (b)Local approximations which follow the divide-and- conquer (D&C) idea to focus on the local subsets of training data. Efﬁciently, local approximations only need to tackle a local expert withm0(m0≪n) data points at each time [19], [20]. Additionally, to produce smooth predictions equippe d with valid uncertainty, modeling averaging has been employ ed through mixture or product of experts [21]–[28]. As depicted in Fig. 2, in terms of scalability, most of the sparse approximations using minducing points and the local approximations using m0=mdata points for each expert have the same training complexity as O(nm2), and they can be further sped up through parallel/distributed co m- puting [20], [29]–[33]. When organizing the inducing point s into Kronecker structure, sparse approximations can furth er reduce the complexity to O(n)[18], [34]. In the meantime, by reorganizing the variational lower bound, stochastic opti miza- tion is available for sparse approximations with a remarkab le complexity of O(m3)[1], [35], [36], enabling the regression with million- and even billion-sized data points [36], [37] . It is notable that we welcome GPs with high scalability but require producing favorable predictions, i.e., good model capa- bility.
